Peeter Joot is a math and physics enthusiast with a love of geometric algebra.
Peeter's education includes a B.A.Sc from UofT ('97 Engineering Science - computer engineering),
a lot of self-study,
most of the interesting
4th year undergrad physics courses (non-degree student),
and is currently working on a part time M.Eng at UofT ('19 ECE electromagnetics).

Peeter's day job is software development.
He has over 20 years of experience with low level systems programing, operating system and hardware abstraction and exploitation, concurrency, and large scale refactoring.
Peeter works for LzLabs and now has fun with PL/I, COBOL, JCL, VSAM, CICS and other legacy subsystems sure to scare away most developers of his generation.
