Peeter Joot is a math and physics enthusiast with a '97 B.A.Sc. from UofT Engineering Science (computer engineering stream).  He is currently working on a part time ECE electromagnetics M.Eng at UofT, and enriched his knowledge by taking most of the interesting 4th year undergrad physics courses as a non-degree student.

Peeter's day job is software development.  He has over 20 years of experience with low level systems programing, operating system and hardware abstraction and exploitation, concurrency, and large scale refactoring.  Peeter works for LzLabs and now has fun with PL/I, COBOL, JCL, VSAM, CICS and other legacy subsystems sure to scare away most developers of his generation.
