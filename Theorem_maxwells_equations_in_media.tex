Maxwell's equations in media are
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\gpgrade{ \stgrad F }{0,1} &= J_\txte \\
\gpgrade{ \stgrad G }{2,3} &= I J_\txtm,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where \( c \) is the group velocity of \( F, G \) in the medium,
the fields are grade 1,2 multivectors
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
F &= \BD + \frac{I}{c}\BH \\
G &= \BE + I c \BB,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
and the sources are grade 0,1 multivectors
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
J_\txte &= \rho - \inv{c}\BJ \\
J_\txtm &= c \rho_\txtm - \BM.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
