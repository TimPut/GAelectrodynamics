To prove \cref{thm:SimpleProducts2:wnormalfactorize}, first assume that there is an orthonormal basis \( \setlr{\ucap, \vcap} \) for the planar subspace \( P = \Span\setlr{ \Ba, \Bb } \), for which

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1840}
\begin{aligned}
\Ba &= (\Ba \cdot \ucap) \ucap + (\Ba \cdot \vcap) \vcap \\
\Bb &= (\Bb \cdot \ucap) \ucap + (\Bb \cdot \vcap) \vcap.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

The wedge of \( \Ba, \Bb \) in terms of this basis is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1860}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\gpgradetwo{
   \lr{
   (\Ba \cdot \ucap) \ucap + (\Ba \cdot \vcap) \vcap
   }
   \lr{
   (\Bb \cdot \ucap) \ucap + (\Bb \cdot \vcap) \vcap
   }
}
=
\gpgradetwo{
\cancel{
   (\Ba \cdot \ucap) (\Bb \cdot \ucap) \ucap^2
}
+
\cancel{
   (\Ba \cdot \vcap) (\Bb \cdot \vcap) \vcap^2
}
+
\lr{
      (\Ba \cdot \ucap)
   (\Bb \cdot \vcap)
   -
   (\Ba \cdot \vcap) (\Bb \cdot \ucap)
}
\ucap \vcap
}
=
\lr{
      (\Ba \cdot \ucap)
   (\Bb \cdot \vcap)
   -
   (\Ba \cdot \vcap) (\Bb \cdot \ucap)
}
\ucap \vcap.
\end{dmath}

Such a basis allows for the most compact (single term) coordinate representation of the wedge product

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1880}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\begin{vmatrix}
   \Ba \cdot \ucap & \Ba \cdot \vcap \\
   \Bb \cdot \ucap & \Bb \cdot \vcap
\end{vmatrix}
\ucap \vcap.
\end{dmath}

The wedge product is therefore the (possibly signed) area of the parallelopiped formed by the vectors \( \Ba, \Bb \), multiplied by a unit pseudoscalar for the subspace of the plane \( P \).  Provided the area of this parallelopiped is non-zero, which is always the case for non-colinear vectors, there are clearly many possible normal factorizations for the wedge product.
