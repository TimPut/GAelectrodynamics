\subsection{\R{2} multiplication table and rotations}

In \R{2} many of the interesting vector products involve the unit bivector \( i = \Be_1 \Be_2 \), the \R{2} unit pseudoscalar.
It is not a coincidence that the symbol for the complex imaginary \( i \) is used for this bivector.
The square of this bivector

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:220}
   \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 }^2
   =
   \Be_1 \Be_2
   \Be_1 \Be_2
   =
   \Be_1 \lr{ \Be_2 \Be_1 } \Be_2
   =
   \Be_1 \lr{ -\Be_1 \Be_2 } \Be_2
   =
   -\lr{ \Be_1 \Be_1 }
   \lr{ \Be_2 \Be_2 }
   = -1,
\end{dmath}

like the complex imaginary, also squares to \( -1 \).

In complex algebra, multiplication by \( \pm i \) will rotate a complex number \( z = x + i y \) by \( \pm \pi/2 \) radians.
Multiplying an \R{2} vector by \( i = \Be_1 \Be_2 \) also produces \( \pi/2 \) rotations, however the rotation direction depends on whether left of right multiplication is used.
Computing the left and right products of \( i \) with the \R{2} basis vectors provides a
simple illustratation of these rotational effects

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:180}
\begin{aligned}
   \Be_1 i &= \Be_1 \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 } \\
           &= \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_1 } \Be_2 \\
           &= \Be_2 \\
   i \Be_1 &= \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 } \Be_1 \\
           &= \lr{ -\Be_2 \Be_1 } \Be_1 \\
           &= -\Be_2 \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_1 } \\
           &= -\Be_2 \\
   \Be_2 i &= \Be_2 \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 } \\
           &= \Be_2 \lr{ -\Be_2 \Be_1 } \\
           &= -\lr{ \Be_2 \Be_2 }\Be_1 \\
           &= -\Be_1 \\
   i \Be_2 &= \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 } \Be_2 \\
           &= \Be_1 \lr{ \Be_2 \Be_2 } \\
           &= \Be_1.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

There are a number of noteworthy aspects of these calculations.

\begin{itemize}
\item The pseudoscalar \( i \) does not commute with either basis vector, but anticommutes with both, since \( i \Be_1 = - \Be_1 i \), and \( i \Be_2 = - \Be_2 i \).  By superposition \( i \) anticommutes with any vector in the plane.
\item The \( i \) products do rotate the basis vectors as claimed, which is
illustrated in \cref{fig:rotationOfe1:rotationOfe1Fig1}.
\item The products of
\cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:220}
\cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:180} can now be tabulated, constructing the geometric algebra multiplication table associated with the \R{2} standard basis.

Given an arbitrary vector in a polar representation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:280}
   \Bx = \rho \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\theta + \Be_2 \sin\theta },
\end{dmath}

left and right multiplication by the unit pseudoscalar gives

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:300}
\begin{aligned}
\Bx i
&= \Bx \Be_1 \Be_2 \\
&= \rho \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\theta + \Be_2 \sin\theta } \Be_1 \Be_2 \\
&= \rho \lr{ \Be_2 \cos\theta - \Be_1 \sin\theta } \\
i \Bx &= \Be_1 \Be_2 \Bx \\
&= \rho \Be_1 \Be_2 \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\theta + \Be_2 \sin\theta } \Be_1 \Be_2 \\
&= \rho \lr{ -\Be_2 \cos\theta + \Be_1 \sin\theta }.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

It is left as a problem for the reader to show (using familiar methods, such as rotation matrices)
that \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:300} are the \( \pi/2 \) counterclockwise and clockwise rotations of \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:280} respectively.  These rotations are illustrated in \cref{fig:rotationOfV:rotationOfVFig1}.

\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/rotationOfVFig1}{\( \pi/2\) rotation using pseudoscalar multiplication.}{fig:rotationOfV:rotationOfVFig1}{0.3}

We can use Euler's formula with the \R{2} pseudoscalar representation of the complex imaginary

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:340}
e^{i \theta} = \cos\theta + i \sin\theta.
\end{dmath}

This can be justified by the fact that \( i = \Be_1 \Be_2 \) commutes with itself.

It is somewhat remarkable that \( \Be_1 \) can be directly factored from the
polar vector representation \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:280}, leaving a complex exponential.
This factorization relies on the trick mentioned earlier, utilizing a unit vector factorization of unity
\( 1 = \Be_1 \Be_1 \).  First factoring \( \Be_1 \) to the left,

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:940}
\Bx
=
\rho \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\theta + \Be_2 \sin\theta }
=
\rho \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\theta + (\Be_1 \Be_1) \Be_2 \sin\theta }
=
\rho \Be_1 \lr{ \cos\theta + \Be_1 \Be_2 \sin\theta }
=
\rho \Be_1 \lr{ \cos\theta + i \sin\theta }
=
\rho \Be_1 e^{i\theta},
\end{dmath}

a complex exponential (a multivector with grades 0,2) is left as a right factor.

Alternatively, by factoring \( \Be_1 \) to the right

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:960}
\Bx
=
\rho \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\theta + \Be_2 \sin\theta }
=
\rho \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\theta + \Be_2 (\Be_1 \Be_1) \sin\theta }
=
\rho \lr{ \cos\theta - \Be_1 \Be_2 \sin\theta } \Be_1
=
\rho \lr{ \cos\theta - i \sin\theta } \Be_1
=
\rho e^{-i\theta} \Be_1,
\end{dmath}

a complex exponential (with negative sign) is left factor.
The polar representation can therefore be expressed as either left or right complex exponential rotation of the vector \( \rho \Be_1 \).

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1120}
\rho \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\theta + \Be_2 \sin\theta }
= \rho e^{-i\theta} \Be_1 = \rho \Be_1 e^{i\theta}
\end{equation}

In general a positive right complex exponential multiplication (of any vector) rotates that vector counterclockwise (i.e. from \( \Be_1 \) to \( \Be_2 \)), whereas a positive left complex exponential multiplication would rotate that vector clockwise.  This is
illustrated in \cref{fig:rotationOfX:rotationOfXFig1}.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/rotationOfXFig1}{Rotation in a plane.}{fig:rotationOfX:rotationOfXFig1}{0.3}

\makedigression{Orientation}{
This is the first hint that a bivector can be thought of having a rotational sense, or orientation.  This is very similar to the orientation change that a vector undergoes by changing its sign.  As we think of vectors as oriented line segments, we will eventually come to think of bivectors as oriented plane segments, trivectors as oriented volume elements, and k-vectors as oriented hypervolumes.
}

\subsection{Vector product, dot product and wedge product.}

The product of two colinear vectors is a scalar, and the product of two normal vectors is a bivector.
To understand the form for a product of two unrestricted vectors, consider their product expressed as a coordinate expansion.  Let

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1160}
\begin{aligned}
\Ba &= \sum_i a_i \Be_i \\
\Bb &= \sum_i b_i \Be_i,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

The product of these vectors is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1360}
\Ba \Bb
=
\lr{ \sum_i a_i \Be_i } \lr{ \sum_j b_j \Be_j }
=
\sum_{ij} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
=
\sum_{i = j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
+
\sum_{i \ne j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
\end{dmath}

The first sum over \( i = j \) is just the dot product since \( \Be_i \Be_i = 1 \), so the general product of two vectors is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1480}
\Ba \Bb
=
\Ba \cdot \Bb
+
\sum_{i \ne j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j.
\end{dmath}

The product of two vectors is a multivector with a scalar (grade 0) component, and a bivector (grade 2) component.  This can be written symbolically as

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1380}{
\Ba \Bb = \gpgradezero{ \Ba \Bb } + \gpgradetwo{ \Ba \Bb }.
}

As a side effect of having performed this expansion, we see that it is possible to compute the dot product of two vectors by scalar grade selection

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1400}{
\Ba \cdot \Bb = \gpgradezero{ \Ba \Bb }.
}

This form of dot product motivates a more general definition of dot product for multivectors, which is

\makedefinition{Multivector dot product}{dfn:gradeselection:100}{
The dot (or inner) product of two multivectors

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
A &= \sum_{i = 0}^N A_i = \sum_{i = 0}^N \gpgrade{A}{i}, \\
B &= \sum_{i = 0}^N B_i = \sum_{i = 0}^N \gpgrade{B}{i},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

is defined as
\begin{equation*}
A \cdot B \equiv
\sum_{i,j = 0}^N \gpgrade{ A_i B_j }{\Abs{i - j}}
\end{equation*}
} % definition

The bivector term of the vector product is called the wedge product, and written as

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1420}{
\Ba \wedge \Bb \equiv \gpgradetwo{ \Ba \Bb }.
}

Similar to the multivector dot product, the multivector wedge product that generalizes
\cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1420} is defined as

\makedefinition{Multivector wedge product.}{dfn:gradeselection:480}{
For the multivectors \( A, B \) defined in \cref{dfn:gradeselection:100}, the wedge (or outer) product is defined as

\begin{equation*}
A \wedge B
\equiv
\sum_{i,j = 0}^N \gpgrade{ A_i B_j }{i + j}.
\end{equation*}
} % definition

Instead of using grade selection, \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1400} can now be expressed as a sum of dot and wedge products

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1440}{
\Ba \Bb = \Ba \cdot \Bb + \Ba \wedge \Bb.
}

This is a very important identity, and will have a number of applications.  
It is premature to consider applications since 
the properties and geometry of the wedge product have not been explored.

To start exploring that geometry let's consider the polar form of the vector, dot and wedge products for two vectors \( \Ba \) and \( \Bb \).
Let \( i_{ab} \) be the unit pseudoscalar for the plane containing these two vectors (where \( \Bb \) is at a positive angle with respect to \( \Ba \) in this plane), and let

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:n}
\begin{aligned}
\Ba &= a \Be_1 e^{ i_{ab} \theta_a } = a e^{ -i_{ab} \theta_a } \Be_1 \\
\Bb &= b \Be_1 e^{ i_{ab} \theta_b } = b e^{ -i_{ab} \theta_b } \Be_1,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

as illustrated in (FIXME).  The vector product of these two vectors is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:n}
\Ba \Bb
=
\lr{ a e^{ -i_{ab} \theta_a } \Be_1 } \lr{ b \Be_1 e^{ i_{ab} \theta_b } }
=
a b 
e^{ -i_{ab} \theta_a } ( \Be_1 \Be_1 ) e^{ i_{ab} \theta_b }
= 
a b 
e^{ i_{ab} (\theta_b - \theta_a)} ,
\end{dmath}

or
\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:n}{
\begin{aligned}
\Ba \Bb &= \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \exp\lr{ i_{ab} (\theta_b - \theta_a) } \\
\Ba \cdot \Bb &= \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \cos( \theta_b - \theta_a ) \\
\Ba \wedge \Bb &= i_{ab} \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \sin( \theta_b - \theta_a ) \\
\end{aligned}
}

The product of two vectors is the product of their magnitudes, multiplied by a ``unit'' complex exponential multivector with grades 0,2.  Recalling that the cross product can be written as \( \Ba \cross \Bb = \ncap_{ab} \sin(\theta_b - \theta_a) \) we see a strong hint that the wedge and cross products are also related.

Let's continue to examine those relationships by examining the properties of the wedge product.

A general property of the wedge product follows by setting \( \Bb = \Ba \) in
\cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1440}, which gives

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1500}
\Ba \Ba = \Ba \cdot \Ba + \Ba \wedge \Ba,
\end{dmath}

but since \( \Ba \Ba = \Ba \cdot \Ba \), we conclude that

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1520}{
\Ba \wedge \Ba = 0.
}

A similar argument shows that the wedge product of any colinear vectors is also zero.
The coordinate expansion of the wedge product (bivector) term in \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1480} can be tidied up to show this explicitly

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1460}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\sum_{i \ne j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
=
\sum_{i < j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
+
\sum_{j < i} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
=
\sum_{i < j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
+
\sum_{i < j} a_j b_i \Be_j \Be_i
=
\sum_{i < j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
+
\sum_{i < j} a_j b_i (-\Be_i \Be_j)
=
\sum_{i < j} (a_i b_j - a_j b_i) \Be_i \Be_j.
\end{dmath}

The scalar factors can be written as a determinants, yielding a tidy coordinate expansion of the wedge product of two vectors

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1320}{
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\sum_{i < j}
\begin{vmatrix}
a_i & a_j \\
b_i & b_j
\end{vmatrix}
\Be_i \Be_j.
}

This expansion shows that the wedge product is antisymmetric (exchanging the vectors toggles the sign), or

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1540}{
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
-\Bb \wedge \Ba,
}

We keep finding similarities between
the wedge product and the cross product, which is not a coincidence.
These similarities can be highlighted by tabulating the cross product properties against those of the (\R{3}) wedge product.

%\label{tab:SimpleProducts2:10}
\begin{tcolorbox}[tab2,tabularx={X||Y|Y},title=Cross product and \R{3} wedge product comparison.,boxrule=0.5pt]

\\ \hline
Same vectors & \( \Ba \cross \Ba = 0 \) & \( \Ba \wedge \Ba = 0 \)
\\ \hline

\end{vmatrix}
\)
&
\(
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\begin{vmatrix}
\Be_2 \Be_3 & \Be_3 \Be_1 & \Be_1 \Be_2 \\
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\

Polar form & 
\( \ncap_{ab} \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \sin( \theta_b - \theta_a )  \) &
\( i_{ab} \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \sin( \theta_b - \theta_a )  \)
\\ \hline
\end{tcolorbox}

It is reasonable to guess that the wedge and cross products are related by some constant multivector factor \( i_{ab} = A \ncap_{ab} \).  In coordinate form, this requires a simultaneous solution to

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1580}
\begin{aligned}
\Be_2 \Be_3 &= A \Be_1 \\
\Be_3 \Be_1 &= A \Be_2 \\
\Be_1 \Be_2 &= A \Be_3.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

Multiplying on the right by \( \Be_1, \Be_2, \Be_3 \) respectively, this factor seems to be

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1600}
A = \Be_2 \Be_3 \Be_1 = \Be_3 \Be_1 \Be_2 = \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3,
\end{equation}

which are all permutations of the \R{3} unit pseudoscalar \( I = \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \).
This indicates that the cyclic permutations of the \R{3} pseudoscalar must all be identical (\cref{problem:SimpleProducts2:permutationspseudoscalar}).

We now have a coordinate free relationship for the \R{3} wedge product and the cross product

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1620}{
\Ba \wedge \Bb = I ( \Ba \cross \Bb ),
}

and can also express the 
\R{3} vector product as a multivector combination of the dot and cross products

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1640}{
\Ba \Bb = \Ba \cdot \Bb + I(\Ba \cross \Bb).
}

Like
\cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1440}, this is also a very important relationship.
In particular, this identity will be what we use to assemble all the separate scalar and vector Maxwell's equations into a single multivector equation.


%Recall that the \R{3} cross product also has the filtering property \( \Ba \cross (\alpha \Ba) = 0 \), and also had an expansion in determinants.
%The wedge product is related to the cross product, but can generalizes the cross product to two dimensions where there is no normal direction, and can generalize the cross product to greater than three dimensions, where any plane has too many normal directions.
%The cross product is a (pseudo)vector that has a magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by the crossed vectors, but is pointed normal to the plane of those vectors.
%It will be possible to interpret the wedge product as the oriented (signed) area of that parallelogram itself without reference to any normal direction.
%In the same sense that a vector is a representation of an oriented line segment, we will see that the
%wedge product of two vectors can be thought of as a representation of a oriented plane segment.

XX

The scalar portion of this product is the dot product, whereas the bivector portion is something else.


We will show that this bivector is related to the \R{3} cross product.
Low
We have found that it is possible to represent the dot product of two

XX
What is the product of two vectors that

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1180}
\Ba \cdot \Bb
=
\gpgradezero{ \Ba \Bb }
=
\gpgradezero{ \lr{ \sum_i a_i \Be_i }
\lr{ \sum_j b_j \Be_j }
}
=
\sum_{ij} a_i b_j \gpgradezero{ \Be_i \Be_j }.
\end{dmath}


In order to discuss the product of two vectors, we have to introduce two additional operators.  The first of these is a generalization of the dot product to multivectors

By this definition, the dot product of two vectors \( \Ba, \Bb \), is

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1140}{
\Ba \cdot \Bb
=
\gpgradezero{ \Ba \Bb }.
}

Before anything else, let's check that this definition agrees with our expectations for a vector dot product.  Let
(cut)
so the generalized dot product is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1560}
\Ba \cdot \Bb
=
\gpgradezero{ \Ba \Bb }
=
\gpgradezero{ \lr{ \sum_i a_i \Be_i }
\lr{ \sum_j b_j \Be_j }
}
=
\sum_{ij} a_i b_j \gpgradezero{ \Be_i \Be_j }.
\end{dmath}

Here a change of index variables was used for \( \Bb \) and the sums and scalars were all factored out of the grade selection operator.  The multivectors \( \Be_i \Be_j \) are unit scalars whenever \( i = j \) and are bivectors whenever \( i \ne j \), so the scalar selection is a Kronecker delta function, leaving

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1200}
\Ba \cdot \Bb
=
\sum_{ij} a_i b_j \delta_{ij}
=
\sum_{i} a_i b_i.
\end{dmath}

As claimed this is the familiar (Euclidean) dot product.
Some examples of vector-bivector, bivector-bivector, and vector-trivector dot products will be considered later.
Since immediate goal is examination of the geometric product of two vectors, we need our second special case grade selection operator, the wedge product


In particular, the wedge product of two vectors \( \Ba, \Bb \) is

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1220}{
\Ba \wedge \Bb = \gpgradetwo{ \Ba \Bb }.
}

Using the coordinate expansion \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1160}, the wedge product of two vectors is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1240}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\gpgradetwo{ \Ba \Bb }
=
\gpgradetwo{ \lr{ \sum_i a_i \Be_i }
\lr{ \sum_j b_j \Be_j }
}
=
\sum_{ij} a_i b_j \gpgradetwo{ \Be_i \Be_j }
\end{dmath}

As pointed out \( \Be_i \Be_j \) is a (unit) scalar whenever \( i = j \), and is a bivector (grade 2) whenever \( i \ne j \), so

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1260}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\sum_{i \ne j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
=
\inv{2}
\sum_{i \ne j} a_i b_j
\Be_i \Be_j
+
\inv{2}
\sum_{r \ne t} a_r b_t
\Be_r \Be_t.
\end{dmath}

The sum has been halved and doubled using a second set of indexes.  This is a sneaky trick often used in physics with indexed (tensor) equations, and worth knowing.  That second sum can now be manipulated

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1280}
\inv{2}
\sum_{r \ne t} a_r b_t
\Be_r \Be_t
=
\inv{2}
\sum_{r \ne t} a_r b_t
(-\Be_t \Be_r)
=
-\inv{2}
\sum_{j \ne i} a_j b_i
\Be_i \Be_j.
\end{dmath}

The normal vectors \( \Be_r, \Be_t \) were first anticommuted (swap the order and the sign), and then a final substitution of summation indexes was made.  Adding the two halves together again gives

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1300}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\inv{2} \sum_{i \ne j} (a_i b_j - a_j b_i) \Be_i \Be_j,
\end{dmath}

or, in terms of determinants

The \R{2} expansion of the wedge product is just

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1340}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\begin{vmatrix}
a_1 & a_2 \\
b_1 & b_2
\end{vmatrix}
\Be_1 \Be_2.
\end{dmath}

Recall (\cref{problem:SimpleProducts2:areaofparallelogram}) that the absolute value of this determinant is precisely the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors \( \Ba \) and \( \Bb \).  The wedge product, a bivector, can therefore be interpretted as an oriented (signed) area.  This is illustrated in \cref{fig:orientedParallelogram:orientedParallelogramFig1}.

\section{REWRITING MARKER END.}

Observe that in \R{2} the product of any basis vector with a pseudoscalar is normal to the original vector, which is also generally true for any vector in a 2D space,
(snip)
%\cref{fig:rotationOfe1:rotationOfe1Fig1}.
%\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/rotationOfe1Fig1}{CAPTION: rotationOfe1Fig1}{fig:rotationOfe1:rotationOfe1Fig1}{0.3}
%\cref{fig:rotationOfe2:rotationOfe2Fig1}.
%\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/rotationOfe2Fig1}{CAPTION: rotationOfe2Fig1}{fig:rotationOfe2:rotationOfe2Fig1}{0.3}
Such a multiplication induces a \( \pi/2 \) rotation, the direction of which depends on the orientation of pseudoscalar, and upon whether the multiplication is performed from the left or the right.

This unit bivector is seen to square to minus one like the imaginary in complex algebra.
The reader can confirm easily that this is generally true for any unit bivector \( \Be_i \Be_j, \, i \ne j \).
This is a very convienient fact, and allows ad-hoc construction of complex number like coordinate systems in any given planar subspace.

\section{Rework}
\paragraph{Computing the normal 2D}

Similar to multiplication by the complex number \( i \),
left and right multiplication by the pseudoscalar also rotate vectors by \( \pi/2 \) radians, however, the sign of the rotation depends on whether the multiplication is from the left or from the right.
With

and multiplication from the right

the vector is rotated clockwise by \( \pi/2 \).
% (\cref{problem:left2dimaginarymultiplication:1}).
%Just as the imaginary rotates complex numbers, the 2D pseudoscalar rotates vectors, with the cavaet that one must be careful about the order that this multiplication is performed.
%
\paragraph{Complex numbers and rotations}

The 2D pseudoscalar has been seen to have the characteristics of the complex imaginary.
This analogy can be extended by noting that the following multivector

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:320}
z = x + \Be_1 \Be_2 y,
\end{dmath}

provides an isomorphic representation of a complex number.
This can be made obvious by introduces the lable \( i = \Be_1 \Be_2 \) for the pseudoscalar, since it has the desired characteristics of the imaginary.

(cut)
Such a complex exponential only rotates vectors that lie in the plane of the bivector, and commute with vector (or vector components) that lie outside of the rotational plane (\cref{problem:normalMult:1}).
This means that conjugate complex exponentials applied from both sides,
rotate the components of the vector that lie in the rotational plane, but leave the normal components unaltered.
The desired expression of a \R{N} rotation
has the ``sandwich'' structure
\footnote{Dual sided rotations of this form are also found in Pauli (matrix) algebra and quaternion formalisms, both of which, like complex numbers, can be considered special cases of geometric algebras.}

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:840}{
\Bx' =
e^{-i\theta/2} \Bx e^{i \theta/2},
}

where \( i \) is the unit bivector for the plane of rotation.
When the vector has no components outside of the plane, single sided rotations can be used, which is often convienient

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:980}
\Bx' = \Bx e^{i \theta} = e^{-i\theta} \Bx.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Vector product.}

The product of two 2D vectors is illustrative.
Let

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:500}
\begin{aligned}
   \Bx &= x_1 \Be_1 + x_2 \Be_2 \\
   \By &= y_1 \Be_1 + y_2 \Be_2
\end{aligned},
\end{dmath}

and consider their product
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:520}
\Bx \By
=
\lr{ x_1 \Be_1 + x_2 \Be_2 }
\lr{ y_1 \Be_1 + y_2 \Be_2 }
=
x_1 y_1 \Be_1 \Be_1 + x_2 y_1 \Be_2 \Be_1
+
x_1 y_2 \Be_1 \Be_2 + x_2 y_2 \Be_2 \Be_2
=
x_1 y_1
- x_2 y_1 \Be_1 \Be_2
+ x_1 y_2 \Be_1 \Be_2
+ x_2 y_2
=
x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2
+ \lr{ x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1 } \Be_1 \Be_2.
\end{dmath}

The vector product has a scalar and a bivector component, where the scalar component is completely symmetric, whereas the bivector component is completely antisymmetric.
Observe that the scalar selection from the vector product is the dot product.
A name is required for the bivector (grade-2) selection from this product, and it is called the wedge product \( \Bx \wedge \By \), an operation that has to be examined in more depth.
With such a definition, the vector product can be written as

%\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:540}
\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:540}{
\Bx \By
= \Bx \cdot \By + \Bx \wedge \By,
}
%\end{dmath}

where

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:560}
\begin{aligned}
\Bx \cdot \By &\equiv \gpgradezero{\Bx\By} = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 \\
\Bx \wedge \By &\equiv \gpgradetwo{\Bx\By} =
\begin{vmatrix}
   x_1 & x_2 \\
   y_1 & y_2
\end{vmatrix}
   \Be_1 \Be_2. \\
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

Because the wedge product is completely antisymmetric, it must be true that

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:580}
\By \wedge \Bx = -\Bx \wedge \By,
\end{dmath}

so
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:600}
\By \Bx
= \By \cdot \Bx + \By \wedge \Bx
= \Bx \cdot \By - \Bx \wedge \By.
\end{dmath}

Taken together \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:540} and \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:600} allow for a construction of a coordinate free form of both the dot and wedge products

%\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:620}
\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:620}{
\begin{aligned}
\Bx \cdot \By   &= \inv{2}\lr{ \Bx \By + \By \Bx } \\
\Bx \wedge \By  &= \inv{2}\lr{ \Bx \By - \By \Bx }.
\end{aligned}
}
%\end{dmath}

These highlight the symmetric and antisymmetric nature of the respective dot and wedge products.
Some authors will use \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:620} as the definitions of the dot and wedge products instead of defining them in terms of grade selection.
Grade selection is preferred here since it allows for a generalization of the wedge product to multiple vectors in higher degree spaces in a particularily simple way, and also allows for the generalization of the dot and wedge products with higher order geometric structures to be discussed.

\paragraph{Area}

It was previously claimed that the pseudoscalar \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \) could be interpretted as an oriented (signed) area.
Because \( \Be_1 \cdot \Be_2 = 0 \), this vector product is also equal to the wedge

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:640}
\Be_1 \Be_2 = \Be_1 \cdot \Be_2 +
\Be_1 \wedge \Be_2
=
\Be_1 \wedge \Be_2.
\end{dmath}

Recall that the area of the parallopiped spanned by two vectors in a two dimensional space is given by the absolute value of

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:660}
\begin{vmatrix}
   x_1 & x_2 \\
   y_1 & y_2
\end{vmatrix},
\end{dmath}

a factor that was also found in the coordinate expansion of the wedge product (\cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:560}).
It is therefore natural to interpret the wedge product as an oriented area.
(cut)
In higher dimensonal spaces, the bivector factor not only encodes a sign for this area, but also its orientation in space.
The wedge product will be seen to encode that orientation without introducing a normal direction for the spanning plane, a nice feature in higher dimensional spaces where a single normal direction is ambiguous.

Because there are many possible pairs of generating vectors for any given bivector, any oriented area in a given plane with a specified area are all equally valid interpretations of a bivector.
This is illustrated in \cref{fig:orientedAreasVariety:orientedAreasVarietyFig1}.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/orientedAreasVarietyFig1}{Different shape representations of a given bivector.}{fig:orientedAreasVariety:orientedAreasVarietyFig1}{0.2}

\paragraph{Projection and rejection}

An immediate application of the vector product is the computation of the projective and rejective components of a vector with respect to another.
This follows by a unit vector factoring of unity \( \ucap^2 = 1 \),

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:680}
\Bx =
\Bx \ucap \ucap
=
\lr{ \Bx \ucap } \ucap
=
\lr{ \Bx \cdot \ucap + \Bx \wedge \ucap } \ucap
=
\lr{ \Bx \cdot \ucap } \ucap + \lr{ \Bx \wedge \ucap } \ucap.
\end{dmath}

The first term \( \lr{ \Bx \cdot \ucap } \ucap \) is the familiar projection along the direction \( \ucap \).
Since both sides of the equation must be a vector, this means that the multivector

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:700}
\lr{ \Bx \wedge \ucap } \ucap
=\Bx - \lr{ \Bx \cdot \ucap } \ucap,
\end{dmath}

is also a vector.
Subtracting the projection from the vector itself is the perpendicular projection, called the \boldTextAndIndex{rejection} in GA literature.
A few of the expected algebraic properties of this multivector rejection expression can be demonstrated.
Recall that the dot product can be computed using scalar grade selection, so

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:720}
\lr{ \lr{ \Bx \wedge \ucap } \ucap } \cdot \lr{ \ucap \lr{ \Bx \cdot \ucap } }
=
\gpgradezero{ \lr{ \Bx \wedge \ucap } \ucap \ucap \lr{ \Bx \cdot \ucap } }
=
\lr{ \Bx \cdot \ucap }
\gpgradezero{ \Bx \wedge \ucap }
= 0.
\end{dmath}

Here the scalar \( \ucap \ucap \lr{ \Bx \cdot \ucap } = \Bx \cdot \ucap \) was brought outside of the grade selection operator, leaving a scalar selection of a bivector, which is zero by definition.
This shows explicitly that the projection and the rejection are perpendicular.
The pythagorean property of these two vector components can also be checked.
Computing the squared length using \( \Norm{\By}^2 = \By \cdot \By = \By^2 \), the squared length of the projective component is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:740}
\lr{ \lr{\Bx \cdot \ucap } \ucap }^2
=
\lr{\Bx \cdot \ucap }^2
=
(x_1 u_1 + x_2 u_2)^2
=
x_1^2 u_1^2 + x_2^2 u_2^2 + 2 x_1 x_2 u_1 u_2.
\end{dmath}

The squared length of the rejective component is
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:760}
\lr{ \lr{\Bx \wedge \ucap } \ucap }^2
=
-(\Bx \wedge \ucap) \ucap^2 (\Bx \wedge \ucap)
=
-
\lr{\begin{vmatrix}
   x_1 & x_2 \\
   u_1 & u_2
\end{vmatrix}}^2
(\Be_1 \Be_2)^2
=
x_1^2 u_2^2 + x_2^2 u_1^2 - 2 x_1 x_2 u_1 u_2.
\end{dmath}

Adding these together gives

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:780}
\lr{ \lr{\Bx \cdot \ucap } \ucap }^2 + \lr{ \lr{\Bx \wedge \ucap } \ucap }^2
=
x_1^2 u_1^2 + x_2^2 u_2^2
+x_1^2 u_2^2 + x_2^2 u_1^2
=
x_1^2 ( u_1^2 + u_2^2 )
+
x_2^2 ( u_1^2 + u_2^2 )
=
\Bx^2,
\end{dmath}

recovering the squared length of the vector as expected.
It is generally true in higher dimensions that the projection and rejection can be written as

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:800}
\begin{aligned}
\Proj_\ucap(\Bx) &= (\Bx \cdot \ucap) \ucap \\
\RejName_\ucap(\Bx) &= (\Bx \wedge \ucap) \ucap.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

The Pythagorean aspect of this statement in higher degree spaces
will be demonstrated later in a coordinate free fashion after some additional identities have been derived.

The unit vector restriction defining the direction of projection and rejection can be relaxed in a compact fashion by introducing the vector \boldTextAndIndex{inverse}, which is always well defined and unique in a Euclidean space

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:860}{
\inv{\Bu} \equiv \frac{\Bu}{\Bu^2}.
}

Now the projection and rejection onto the direction of \( \Bu \) are

\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:880}{
\begin{aligned}
\Proj_\Bu(\Bx) &= (\Bx \cdot \Bu) \inv{\Bu} \\
\RejName_\Bu(\Bx) &= (\Bx \wedge \Bu) \inv{\Bu}.
\end{aligned}
}
\index{projection}
\index{rejection}

An illustrative example of both projection and rejection is plotted in \cref{fig:projectionAndRejection:projectionAndRejectionFig1}.

\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/projectionAndRejectionFig1}{Projection and rejection illustrated.}{fig:projectionAndRejection:projectionAndRejectionFig1}{0.3}

\makedigression{Wedge and cross product relationships}{
Given that the wedge product has the ``cross product like'' properties \( \Bx \wedge \Bx = 0 \), and \( \Bx \wedge \By = -\By \wedge \Bx \),
and because the \R{3} expression of the rejection is

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:820}
\RejName_\ucap(\Bx) = \Bx - (\Bx \cdot \ucap) \ucap = \ucap \cross (\Bx \cross \ucap),
\end{equation}

which is clearly similar to that of \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:800}, the observant reader may see from this expression that the wedge product in \R{3} seems to be related to the cross product in some fashion.
The precise nature of that relationship will be detailed later.
} % digression

\paragraph{Reflection}
\index{reflection}

Computation of the reflection of a vector through the origin, across the direction given by the vector \( \Bu \) (also passing through the origin) can now be expressed compactly.
That is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:900}
\Bx'
= \lr{ \Bx \cdot \Bu }\Bu - \lr{ \Bx \wedge \Bu } \inv{\Bu }
= \lr{ \Bx \cdot \Bu - \Bx \wedge \Bu } \inv{\Bu }
= \inv{2} \lr{ \Bx \Bu + \Bu \Bx - \Bx \Bu + \Bu \Bx } \inv{\Bu },
\end{dmath}

or
\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:920}{
\Bx' = \Bu \Bx \inv{\Bu}.
}

An illustration of the geometry of reflection is provided in \cref{fig:reflection:reflectionFig1}.

\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/reflectionFig1}{Reflection}{fig:reflection:reflectionFig1}{0.3}

\paragraph{Solution of linear systems}

Various types of linear systems can be solved using the wedge product.
An illustrative example is that of the intersection of two lines as illustrated in \cref{fig:intersectionOfLines:intersectionOfLinesFig1}.

\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/intersectionOfLinesFig1}{Intersection of two lines.}{fig:intersectionOfLines:intersectionOfLinesFig1}{0.3}

In parametric form, the lines in this problem are

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1000}
\begin{aligned}
\Br_1(s) &= \Ba_0 + s( \Ba_1 - \Ba_2 ) \\
\Br_2(t) &= \Bb_0 + t( \Bb_1 - \Bb_2 ),
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

so the solution, if it exists, is found at the point satisfying the equality

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1020}
\Ba_0 + s( \Ba_1 - \Ba_2 ) = \Bb_0 + t( \Bb_1 - \Bb_2 ).
\end{dmath}

With
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1040}
\begin{aligned}
\Bu_1 &= \Ba_1 - \Ba_2 \\
\Bu_2 &= \Bb_1 - \Bb_2 \\
\Bd &= \Ba_0 - \Bb_0,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

so the desired equation to solve is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1060}
\Bd + s \Bu_1 = t \Bu_2.
\end{dmath}

In \R{3} this problem can solved using the cross product (\cref{problem:crossProductLinearIntersectionProblem:1}), however, this can be solved more generally as a
bivector equation by wedging both sides with either \( \Bu_1 \) or \( \Bu_2 \)

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1080}
\begin{aligned}
\Bd \wedge \Bu_1 &= t \Bu_2 \wedge \Bu_1 \\
\Bd \wedge \Bu_2 + s \Bu_1 \wedge \Bu_2 &= 0,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

In \R{2} these equations have a solution if \( \Bu_1 \wedge \Bu_2 \ne 0 \), and in \R{N} these have solutions if the bivectors on each sides of the equations describe the same plane.
Put another way, these have solutions when \( s \) and \( t \) are scalars and

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1100}
\begin{aligned}
s &= \frac{\Bu_2 \wedge \Bd}{\Bu_1 \wedge \Bu_2} \\
t &= \frac{\Bu_1 \wedge \Bd}{\Bu_1 \wedge \Bu_2}.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

For \R{2},
where the wedge product can be expressed as a (unit bivector scaled) determinant, this is precisely the Cramer's rule solution of the equivalent matrix equation.
