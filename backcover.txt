Geometric algebra generalizes vectors to multivectors, and provides an algebraic representations of not just directed line segments, but also points, plane segments, and volumes.  This abstraction can be exploited in the study of electromagnetism.  Maxwell's equation in its multivector form is a simpler theoretical starting point for a variety of topics in electromagnetic analysis.  
This book details how to use geometric algebra for electromagnetic analysis and provides all of the prerequisite concepts and theory required to do so.  This book targets advanced undergraduate students in electrical engineering or physics, and aims to make the subject more accessible than the available research material.
