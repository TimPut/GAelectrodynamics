\subsection{Operational rules}
For Euclidean vector spaces, spaces for which the length of a vector is always positive, a couple operational vector multiplication rules are sufficient to some basic familiarity with the algebra and derive some important conquences.
Assuming an orthonormal basis \( \setlr{ \Be_1, \Be_2, \cdots } \), those rules are

\makerule{Square of a unit vector.}{rule:simple:square}{
The square of a unit vector, such as \( \Be_1 \) is 1, a scalar.  Stated more generally

\begin{equation*}
\Be_i \Be_i = 1, \quad \forall i \in 1, 2, \cdots
\end{equation*}
}

\makerule{Orthogonal unit vectors anticommute.}{rule:simple:anticommute}{
The product of two orthognal unit vectors, such as \( \Be_2 \Be_1 \) anticommutes.  That is \( \Be_2 \Be_1 = - \Be_1 \Be_2 \).  Stated more generally
\begin{equation*}
\Be_i \Be_j = -\Be_j \Be_i, \quad \forall i \ne j \in 1, 2, \cdots
\end{equation*}
}

In addition to these rules, one must assume that linear combinations of products of unit vectors are well formed.
