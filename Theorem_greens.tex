Given a vector \( \Bf = \sum_i f_i \Bx^i \) in \R{N}, and a surface parameterized by \( \Bx = \Bx(u_1, u_2) \), \textit{Green's theorem}
states
\begin{equation*}
\int_S du_1 du_2 \lr{ \PD{u_2}{f_1} - \PD{u_1}{f_2} }
=
\ointclockwise_{\partial S} du_1 f_1 + du_2 f_2.
\end{equation*}
This is
often stated for vectors
\( \Bf = P \Be_1 + Q \Be_2 \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) with a Cartesian \(x,y\) parameterization as
\begin{equation*}
\int_S dx dy \lr{ \PD{y}{P} - \PD{x}{Q} }
=
\ointclockwise_{\partial S} P dx + Q dy.
\end{equation*}
