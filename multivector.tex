Geometric algebra takes a vector space and adds two additional operations, a vector multiplication operation, and a generalized addition operation that extends vector addition to include addition of scalars and products of vectors.
Multiplication of vectors is indicated by juxtaposition, for example, if \( \Bx, \By, \Be_1, \Be_2, \Be_3, \cdots \) are vectors, then some vector products are

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multivector:20}
\begin{aligned}
&\Bx \By, \Bx \By \Bx, \Bx \By \Bx \By, \\
&\Be_1 \Be_2, \Be_2 \Be_1, \Be_2 \Be_3, \Be_3 \Be_2, \Be_3 \Be_1, \Be_1 \Be_3, \\
&\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3, \Be_3 \Be_1 \Be_2, \Be_2 \Be_3 \Be_1, \Be_3 \Be_2 \Be_1, \Be_2 \Be_1 \Be_3, \Be_1 \Be_3 \Be_2, \\
&\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \Be_1, \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \Be_1 \Be_3 \Be_2, \cdots
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

Vector multiplication is constrained by a rule, the contraction axiom, which specifies that the square of vector is the squared length of that vector (i.e. a scalar).

In a sum of scalars, vectors, and vector products, such as
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multivector:40}
1 + 2 \Be_1 + 3 \Be_1 \Be_2 + 4 \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3,
\end{dmath}
the value \( 1 \) is a scalar (or 0-vector), \( 2 \Be_1 \) is a vector (or 1-vector),
\( 3 \Be_1 \Be_2 \) is called a bivector (or 2-vector), \( 4 \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \) is called a trivector (or 3-vector), and the sum itself is called a multivector.
Geometric algebra uses vector multiplication to build up a hierarchy of geometrical objects, representing oriented points, lines, planes, volumes and in higher dimensional spaces oriented hypervolumes.

\index{scalar}
\index{0-vector}
\paragraph{Scalar.}
A scalar (or 0-vector) can be represented graphically as an arrow with a head and a tail pointing into the paper (or chalkboard.)
The sign of a scalar, represented by a ``head'' or ``tail'' can be thought of as an orientation, as illustrated in
\cref{fig:scalarOrientation:scalarOrientationFig1} with a crossed circle for the tail, and a solid dot as the head.
We don't usually try to represent of a quantity that has the apparent dimensions of a point graphically.
%The magnitude of this scalar could be represented by the size of the head or tail symbol, or perhaps just by putting a number beside the symbol.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/scalarOrientationFig1}{Scalar orientation.}{fig:scalarOrientation:scalarOrientationFig1}{0.05}

\index{vector}
\index{1-vector}
\paragraph{Vector.}
A vector can be prepresented graphically as an arrow with a head and a tail, as illustrated in
\cref{fig:VectorsWithOppositeOrientation:VectorsWithOppositeOrientationFig1}.
Here the orientation has two aspects, one is the direction in space of the vector, and the other is the relative placement of the head vs. tail of the vector, which is toggled by changing the sign of the vector.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/VectorsWithOppositeOrientationFig1}{Vector orientation.}{fig:VectorsWithOppositeOrientation:VectorsWithOppositeOrientationFig1}{0.3}
Graphically we can add vectors by connecting them head to tail, and connecting the end points, as illustrated in
\cref{fig:vectorAddition:vectorAdditionFig1}.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/vectorAdditionFig1}{Graphical vector addition.}{fig:vectorAddition:vectorAdditionFig1}{0.3}

\index{bivector}
\index{2-vector}
\paragraph{Bivector.}

Assuming a vector product, a bivector can be defined as

\makedefinition{Bivector.}{dfn:multivector:60}{
A bivector, or 2-vector, is a sum of products of pairs of normal vectors.
Given an \( N \) dimensional vector space with an orthonormal basis \( \setlr{ \Be_1, \Be_2, \cdots } \),
a general bivector can be expressed as
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{1 \le i \ne j \le N} B_{ij} \Be_i \Be_j,
\end{equation*}
where \( B_{ij} \) is a scalar.
} % definition

The set \( \setlr{ \Be_i \Be_j \mid i \ne j } \) could be considered a basis for the space of bivectors, generated from the underlying vector space and the vector product.
We will see later that this is a linear dependent set, and that the bivector space can be defined as \( \Span \setlr{ \Be_i \Be_j \mid i < j } \).
The bivectors that we will encounter in physics, such as torque and angular momentum, can all be represented as oriented plane
segments.
Like vectors, this orientation includes a ``sidedness'' as well as directions in space.
In three dimensions this sidedness can be represented using a vector normal to the plane.  In two and \( N \) dimensions this orientation can be 
represented using a cyclic direction on the surface of the plane segment as illustrated in
\cref{fig:orientedAreas:orientedAreasFig1}.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/orientedAreasFig1}{Oriented unit areas in the x-y plane.}{fig:orientedAreas:orientedAreasFig1}{0.2}

Fixme: 3d example figure.

Fixme: addition example figure and discussion.

%We will see that the products of normal vectors, like \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \) anticommute\footnote{Quantities that anticommute are unchanged if both the order and the sign are toggled.},
%for example \( \Be_2 \Be_1 = -\Be_1 \Be_2 \).
%This means that many of the products in \cref{eqn:multivector:20} are not independent, and that the definition of a bivector could be a more restrictive sum, such as \( \sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} b_{ij} \Be_i \Be_j \), where \( b_{ij} \) is an antisymmetric
%\footnote{An indexed quantity such as \( b_{ij} \) is antisymmetric if toggling the order of indexes changes the sign, that is \( b_{ji} = -b_{ij} \).}
%scalar.

\index{trivector}
\index{3-vector}
\paragraph{Trivector.}

Again, assuming a vector product

\makedefinition{Trivector.}{dfn:multivector:80}{
A trivector, or 3-vector, is a sum of products of triplets of mutually normal vectors.
Given an \( N \) dimensional vector space with an orthonormal basis \( \setlr{ \Be_1, \Be_2, \cdots } \),
a general trivector can be expressed as
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{1 \le i \ne j \ne k \le N} T_{ijk} \Be_i \Be_j \Be_k,
\end{equation*}
where \( \T_{ijk} \) is a scalar.
} % definition

In three dimensional space, we will see that all trivectors are scalar multiples of \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \), and
can represent an oriented volume segment such as the differential form in a volume integral.
This orientation can be visualized with a normal pointing into or out of the volume, or like bivectors, with a cyclic direction on the surface of the volume as in illustrated with the spherical volume of \cref{fig:orientedVolume:orientedVolumeFig1}.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/orientedVolumeFig1}{Oriented Volume}{fig:orientedVolume:orientedVolumeFig1}{0.3}
%In greater than three dimensions, a trivector can have a ``direction'' in the higher dimensional space, as well as a sidedness.
%As was the case with the bivector, because not all the products \( \Be_i \Be_j \Be_k \) for any set of indexes \( i, j, k \) are independent, it is possible to form a trivector as a sum over a more restricted set, such as \( \sum_{1 \le i < j < k \le N} T_{ijk} \Be_i \Be_j \Be_k \).
%In particular, in three dimensions, all trivectors can be expressed as scalar multiples of \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \).
%
\index{k-vector}
\index{grade}
\paragraph{K-vector.}
\makedefinition{K-vector and grade.}{dfn:multivector:100}{
A k-vector is a sum of products of \( k \) mutually normal vectors.
Given an \( N \) dimensional vector space with an orthonormal basis \( \setlr{ \Be_1, \Be_2, \cdots } \),
a general k-vector can be expressed as
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{1 \le i_1 \ne i_2 \cdots \ne i_k \le N} K_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_k} \Be_{i_1} \Be_{i_2} \cdots \Be_{i_k},
\end{equation*}
where \( K_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_k} \) is a scalar.

The number \( k \) of normal vectors that generate a k-vector is called the grade.

A 1-vector is defined as a vector, and a 0-vector is defined as a scalar.
} % definition

We will see that the highest grade for a k-vector in an N dimensional vector space is \( N \).

\index{multivector}
\index{multivector space}
\paragraph{Multivector space.}
\makedefinition{Multivector space.}{def:multiplication:multivectorspace}{
   Given an N dimensional (generating) vector space \( V \) with an orthonormal basis \( \setlr{ \Be_1, \Be_2, \cdots, \Be_N } \),
%a basis \( \setlr{ \Bx_1, \Bx_2, \cdots } \),
and a vector multiplication operation represented by juxtaposition,
a multivector is a sum of k-vectors, \( k \in [ 1, N ] \), such as
   \( a_0 + \sum_i a_i \Be_i + \sum_{i \ne j} a_{ij} \Be_i \Be_j + \sum_{i \ne j \ne k} a_{ijk} \Be_i \Be_j \Be_k + \cdots \), where \( a_0, a_i, a_{ij}, \cdots \) are scalars.

A multivector space is a set \( M = \setlr{ x, y, z, \cdots } \) of multivectors, where the following axioms are satisfied

\begin{tcolorbox}[tab2,tabularx={X|Y},title=Multivector space axioms.,boxrule=0.5pt]
    Contraction. & \( \Bx^2 = \Bx \cdot \Bx, \,\forall \Bx \in V \) \\ \hline
    Addition is closed. & \( x + y \in M \) \\ \hline
    Multiplication is closed. & \( x y \in M \) \\ \hline
    Addition is associative. & \( (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) \) \\ \hline
    Addition is commutative. & \( y + x = x + y \) \\ \hline
    There exists a zero element \( 0 \in M \).  & \( x + 0 = x \) \\ \hline
    There exists a negative additive inverse \( -x \in M \). & \( x + (-x) = 0 \) \\ \hline
    Multiplication is distributive.  & \( x( y + z ) = x y + x z \), \( (x + y)z = x z + y z \) \\ \hline
    Multiplication is associative. & \( (x y) z = x ( y z ) \) \\ \hline
    There exists a multiplicative identity \( 1 \). & \( 1 x = x \) \\ \hline
\end{tcolorbox}
}

Compared to the vector space, def'n. \ref{def:prerequisites:vectorspace}, the multivector space

\begin{itemize}
\item presumes a vector multiplication operation, which is not assumed to be commutative (order matters),
\item generalizes vector addition to multivector addition,
\item generalizes scalar multiplication to multivector multiplication (of which scalar multiplication and vector multiplication are special cases),
\item and most importantly, specifies a rule providing the meaning of a squared vector (the contraction axiom).
\end{itemize}

The contraction axiom is arguably the most important of the multivector space axioms, as it allows for multiplicative closure without an infinite dimensional multivector space.
The remaining set of non-contraction axioms of a multivector space are almost that of a field
\footnote{A mathematician would call a multivector space a non-commutative ring with identity \citep{van1943modern}, and could state the multivector space definition much more compactly without listing all the properties of a ring explicitly as done above.}
(as encountered in the study of complex inner products),
as they describe most of the properties one
would expect of a ``well behaved'' set of number-like quantities.
However, a field also requires a multiplicative inverse element for all elements of the space, which exists for some multivector subspaces, but not in general.

%These axioms may seem simple enough, especially since they are not that different from the familiar axioms of the vector space,
%but it will take considerable work to extract all their consequences.
%The subject of Geometric Algebra can be viewed as the study of the impliciations of the axioms
%of the multivector space.
