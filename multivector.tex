\section{Multivectors}

\subsection{Multivector space.}

The first lesson that must be learned in the study in GA, is to unlearn claims
%\footnote{I heard such claims from high school math and physics teachers.}
that vectors cannot be multiplied.
Instead we start by assuming that a multiplication operation between any number of vectors can be defined,
and that sums, called multivectors, of scalars, vectors, and any products of vectors are also well defined.
These rules are formalized in the definition of a multivector space.

\makedefinition{Multivector space.}{def:multiplication:multivectorspace}{
   Given a (generating) vector space \( V \) with a basis \( \setlr{ \Bx_1, \Bx_2, \cdots } \), a multivector is any sum

   \( a_0 + \sum_i a_i \Bx_i + \sum_{ij} a_{ij} \Bx_i \Bx_j + \sum_{ijk} \Bx_i \Bx_j \Bx_k + \cdots \), where \( a_0, a_i, a_{ij}, \cdots \) are scalars,
and vector multiplication is represented by juxtaposition.

   A multivector space is a set \( M = \setlr{ x, y, z, \cdots } \) of multivectors, where the following axioms are satisfied

\begin{tcolorbox}[tab2,tabularx={X|Y},title=Multivector space axioms.,boxrule=0.5pt]
    Contraction. & \( \Bx^2 = \Bx \cdot \Bx, \forall \Bx \in V \) \\ \hline
    Addition is closed. & \( x + y \in M \) \\ \hline
    Multiplication is closed. & \( x y \in M \) \\ \hline
    Addition is associative. & \( (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) \) \\ \hline
    Addition is commutative. & \( y + x = x + y \) \\ \hline
    There exists a zero element \( 0 \in M \).  & \( x + 0 = x \) \\ \hline
    There exists a negative additive inverse \( -x \in M \). & \( x + (-x) = 0 \) \\ \hline
    Multiplication is distributive.  & \( z( x + y ) = z x + z y \), \( (z + w)x = z x + w x \) \\ \hline
    Multiplication is associative. & \( (x y) z = x ( y z ) \) \\ \hline
    There exists a multiplicative identity \( 1 \). & \( 1 x = x \) \\ \hline
\end{tcolorbox}
}

The definition of a multivector space is strikingly similar to that of the vector space, def'n. \ref{def:prerequisites:vectorspace}, with the following changes

\begin{itemize}
\item In the axioms, any references to vectors are changed to multivectors.
\item Scalar multiplication is generalized to multivector multiplication (of which scalar multiplication is a special case).
\item The vector addition operation is generalized to multivector addition.
\item A vector multiplication operation is presumed.
\item A rule that specifies the meaning of a product of a vector with itself is provided (the contraction axiom).
\end{itemize}

These axioms may seem simple enough, especially since they are not that different from the familiar axioms of the vector space,
but it will take considerable work to extract all their consequences.

The subject of Geometric Algebra can be viewed as the study of the impliciations of the axioms
of the multivector space.

\subsection{Nomenclature: grade, k-vector, bivector, trivector.}

To facilitate discussion, it is useful to first introduce some nomenclature.

\makedefinition{Blade and grade}{def:multiplication:blade}{
A product of \( k \) perpendicular vectors is called a k-blade, or a blade of grade \( k \).
A grade zero blade defined as a scalar.

The shorthand \( F \in \bigwedge^k \), often seen in GA literature, which means that \( F \) is a blade of grade \( k \).
}

The multivector
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multiplication:220}
\Be_1 \Be_2 + 3 \Be_1 \Be_3
=
\Be_1 (\Be_2 + 3 \Be_3),
\end{dmath}

which can be factored into two perpendicular vectors is a blade, whereas the grade two multivectors

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multiplication:240}
\Be_1 \Be_2 + 3 \Be_3 \Be_4,
\end{dmath}

and
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multiplication:260}
\Be_1 \Be_2 + \Be_2 \Be_3 + \Be_3 \Be_1
\end{dmath}

are not.

\makedefinition{K-vector.}{dfn:multivector:kvector}{
A sum of k-blades is called a k-vector.
} % definition

Multivectors are therefore sums of k-vectors with different grades.

The maximum grade of a multivector is equal to the dimension of the generating vector space.
For example, for a multivector space generated by \R{3}, no k-vector can have grade greater than 3.

Examples of k-vectors with grades 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively are

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multivector:180}
\begin{aligned}
&1 \\
&\Be_1, \Be_2, \Be_3 \\
&\Be_1 \Be_2, \Be_2 \Be_1, \Be_1 \Be_2 + \Be_2 \Be_3, \Be_1 \Be_2 + \Be_3 \Be_4 \\
&\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3, \Be_1 \Be_3 \Be_2, \Be_1 \Be_4 \Be_2
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

K-vectors with grades 2 and 3 are so pervasive that we give them special names.

\makedefinition{Bivector.}{dfn:multivector:bivector}{
A bivector, or 2-vector, is a k-vector with grade 2.
} % definition

The product \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \) is a bivector, as is \( \Be_2 \Be_3 + 3 \Be_4 \Be_1 \)
%Each of \( \Be_1 \Be_2, \Be_2 \Be_1, \Be_1 \Be_2 + \Be_2 \Be_3 \), and \( \Be_1 \Be_2 + \Be_3 \Be_4 \) are bivectors.
%All but the last of these represents an oriented plane segment.

\makedefinition{Trivector.}{dfn:multivector:trivector}{
A trivector, or 3-vector, is a k-vector with grade 3.
} % definition

%Quantities with higher grades than 3 are not generally given explicit names.
The multivector \( \Be_3 \Be_1 \Be_2 \) is a trivector, as is \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 + 3 \Be_5 \Be_4 \Be_1 \).  The latter is not a blade.
%Each of \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3, \Be_1 \Be_3 \Be_2, \Be_1 \Be_4 \Be_2 \) are trivectors.
% , and represent oriented volumes.

\paragraph{Some justification for the contraction axiom.}

\input{multiplication.tex}

\subsection{Unpacking the axioms.}

Unless otherwise stated, a Euclidean vector space with an orthonormal basis \( \setlr{\Be_1, \Be_2, \cdots } \) is assumed for the remainder of this chapter.
Generalizations required for non-Euclidean spaces will be discussed when spacetime vectors are introduced.
%  At that point, it is a good exersize for the reader to come back to this, and determine where any result

\paragraph{Effects of commutation of normal vectors.}

One of the consequences of the contraction axiom is that
the square of any unit vector, such as any \( \Be_i \) is also unity

%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiplication:300}
\boxedEquation{eqn:multiplication:320}{
\Be_i^2 = 1.
}
%\end{equation}

Now consider the square of the vector with its head at \( (1,1) \), as sketched in \cref{fig:unitSum:unitSumFig1}.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/unitSumFig1}{\( \Be_1 + \Be_2 \).}{fig:unitSum:unitSumFig1}{0.3}
By the contraction axiom, the square of this vector is \( 2\), but can also be computed by expansion, and a second application of the contraction axiom

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gaTutorial:80}
2
=
(\Be_1 + \Be_2)^2
= (\Be_1 + \Be_2)(\Be_1 + \Be_2)
= \Be_1^2 + \Be_2 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2 + \Be_2^2
= 2 + \Be_2 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2.
\end{dmath}

This equation has a scalar component on the left hand side, and a mixed grade multivector with grades zero and two on the right hand side.
The only possible solution requires that the grade two components of this equation are zero.  That is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multivector:280}
\Be_2 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2 = 0,
\end{dmath}

or
%\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multiplication:140}
\boxedEquation{eqn:multiplication:140}{
\Be_1 \Be_2 = -\Be_1 \Be_2.
}
%\end{dmath}

We see that this product of two orthonormal vectors anticommutes (changing the order, changes the sign).  In general this is true of any normal vectors.

\maketheorem{Normal anticommutation}{thm:multiplication:anticommutationNormal}{
The product of any two normal vectors \(\Bu\), and \(\Bv\) anticommute.
\begin{equation*}
\Bu \Bv = -\Bv \Bu.
\end{equation*}
} % theorem

\paragraph{Mixed grade sums}
In traditional vector algebra, the
``weird'' sum of a scalar and vector is forbidden and undefined, but is explicitly allowed in GA.  For example,

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multivector:240}
1 + \Be_1,
\end{dmath}

is a simple mixed grade multivector.
Such mixed grade mathematical objects are not only well defined in GA, but are required to represent some vector products.  One of the simplest examples is the following vector product

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multivector:260}
\Be_1 ( \Be_1 + \Be_2 )
=
\Be_1 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2
=
\Be_1 \cdot \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2
=
1 + \Be_1 \Be_2,
\end{dmath}

where the last step assumes the vector space is Euclidean.
