\index{plane wave}
\index{polarization}
In a discussion of polarization, it is convenient to align the propagation direction along a fixed direction, usually the z-axis.
%%\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:frequencydomainPlaneWaves:200}
%\boxedEquation
%{eqn:frequencydomainPlaneWaves:200}
%{
%F = (1 + \kcap) \BE_0 e^{-j \Bk \cdot \Bx},
%}
%%\end{dmath}
Setting \( \kcap = \Be_3, \beta z = \Bk \cdot \Bx \)
in a
plane wave representation from
\cref{thm:planewavesMultivector:620}
%\cref{eqn:frequencydomainPlaneWaves:200} the plane wave representation of
the field is
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:polarization:20}
\begin{aligned}
F(\Bx, \omega) &= (1 + \Be_3) \BE e^{-j \beta z} \\
F(\Bx, t) &= \Real\lr{ F(\Bx, \omega) e^{j \omega t} },
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
where \( \BE \cdot \Be_3 = 0 \)
, (i.e. \( \BE \) is an electric field, and not just a free parameter).

Here the imaginary \( j \) has no intrinsic geometrical interpretation, \( \BE = \BE_\txtr + j \BE_\txti \) is allowed to have complex values, and all components of \( \BE \) is perpendicular to the propagation direction (\( \Be_\txtr \cdot \Be_3 = \BE_\txti \cdot \Be_3 = 0 \)).
\index{Jones vector}
A common representation of the electric field components is the Jones vector \( (c_1, c_2) \), which specifies complex coefficients for the electric field phasor in each of the possible directions
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:polarization:120}
\BE = c_1 \Be_1 + c_2 \Be_2,
\end{dmath}
where \( c_1, c_2 \) are complex valued, say
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:polarization:140}
\begin{aligned}
c_1 &= \alpha_1 + j \beta_1 \\
c_2 &= \alpha_2 + j \beta_2.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

The tuple \( (c_1, c_2) \) is called the Jones vector, and compactly encodes the geometry of the pattern that the electric field traces out in the transverse plane.
