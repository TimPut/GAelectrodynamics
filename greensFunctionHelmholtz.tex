\subsubsection{Unbounded superposition solutions for the Helmholtz equation.}

(FIXME: reference)
We can utilize \cref{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:160} to illustrate the Green's function technique.
As this equation is a linear differential operator relating the wave and the driving sources,
it is reasonable to assume that the solution also has a general linear structure, such as

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:100}
F(\Bx) = \int dV' B(\Bx') G(\Bx, \Bx') + F_0(\Bx),
\end{dmath}

where the function \( G(\Bx, \Bx') \) is called the Green's function for the Helmholtz operator, and \( F_0 \) is any particular solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation \( \lr{ \spacegrad^2 + k^2 } F_0 = 0 \).
Operating on \cref{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:100} with the Helmholtz operator \( \spacegrad + k^2 \) we find that the Green's function must
satisfy

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:140}
\lr{ \spacegrad^2 + k^2 } G(\Bx, \Bx') = \delta(\Bx - \Bx').
\end{dmath}

While it is possible \citep{schwinger1998classical} to derive the Green's function using Fourier transform techniques, we will state the result instead, which is well known

\index{Helmholtz!Green's function}

\maketheorem{Green's function for the Helmholtz operator.}{thm:gradientGreensFunctionEuclidean:3}{
The advancing (causal), and the receding (acausal) Green's functions satisfying
\cref{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:140} are respectively

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
G_{\textrm{adv}}(\Bx, \Bx') &= -\frac{e^{-j k \Norm{ \Bx - \Bx' } }}{ 4 \pi \Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}} \\
G_{\textrm{rec}}(\Bx, \Bx') &= -\frac{e^{j k \Norm{ \Bx - \Bx' } }}{ 4 \pi \Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
} % theorem

We will use the advancing Green's function, and refer to this function as \( G(\Bx, \Bx') \) without any subscript.
A demonstration that these Green's function representations are valid can be found in \cref{chap:helmholtzGreens}.

\index{Laplacian!Green's function}
\index{Green's function!Laplacian}
Observe that as a special case, the Helmholtz Green's function reduces to the Green's function for the Laplacian when \( k = 0 \)

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:80}
G(\Bx, \Bx') = -\inv{ 4 \pi \Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}}.
\end{dmath}

\subsubsection{Bounded superposition solutions for the Helmholtz equation.}

For our application of
{thm:gradientGreensFunctionEuclidean:3} to the Helmholtz problem, we
are actually interested in a antisymmetric sandwich of the Helmholtz operator by the function \( F \) and the scalar (Green's) function \( G \), but
that reduces to a sandwich of Laplacian's

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:240}
F \lr{ \spacegrad^2 + k^2 } G - G \lr{ \spacegrad^2 + k^2 } F
=
F \spacegrad^2 G + \cancel{F k^2 G} - G \spacegrad^2 F - \cancel{G k^2 F}
=
F \spacegrad^2 G - G \spacegrad^2 F,
\end{dmath}

so

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:380}
\int_V F(\Bx') \lr{ (\spacegrad')^2 + k^2 } G(\Bx, \Bx')
=
\int_V G(\Bx, \Bx') \lr{ (\spacegrad')^2 + k^2} F(\Bx') dV'
+
\int_{\partial V} \lr{ F(\Bx') (\ncap' \cdot \spacegrad') G(\Bx, \Bx') - G(\Bx, \Bx') (\ncap' \cdot \spacegrad') F(\Bx') } dA'
\end{dmath}

This shows that if we assume the Green's function satisfies
the delta function condition
\cref{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:140}
%that was also true for the unbounded case
, then the general solution to \cref{eqn:greensFunctionOverview:160} is
(FIXME: reference)

\boxedEquation{eqn:gradientGreensFunctionEuclidean:400}{
\begin{aligned}
F(\Bx) &=
\int_V G(\Bx, \Bx') B( \Bx' ) dV' \\
&+
\int_{\partial V} \lr{
 G(\Bx, \Bx') (\ncap' \cdot \spacegrad') F(\Bx')
-F(\Bx') (\ncap' \cdot \spacegrad') G(\Bx, \Bx')
} dA'.
\end{aligned}
}

We are also free to add in any specific solution \( F_0(\Bx) \) that satisfies the
homogeneous Helmholtz equation.
There is also freedom to add any solution of the homogeneous Helmholtz equation to the Green's function itself, so it is not unique.
For a bounded superposition we generally desire that the solution \( F \) and its normal derivative, or the Green's function \( G \) (and it's normal derivative) or an appropriate combination of the two are zero on the boundary, so that the surface integral is killed.
