Engineering & Comp. Sci. 
QA76.9 .M35 A658 2002X

   -- one article "A Hestenes STA approach to Light Polarization" by Sugon and McNamera was relavent (Stokes, Poincare sphere, e&m tensor content), but all in GAFP.

*)

Clifford algebras : applications to mathematics, physics, and engineering /
Rafał Abłamowicz, editor.

Physics Stacks QA199 .C554 2003

   -- The Doran and Lasenby chapter is relavent, but it's a rehash of GAFP.  Didn't borrow from the library.

*)

Geometric algebra and applications to physics /
Venzo de Sabbata, Bidyut Kumar Datta.

Gerstein Science Stacks QC20.7 .A37 D4 2007X

Lectures on Clifford geometric algebras and applications /
Rafał Abłamowicz, Garret Sobczyk, editors.
Mathematical Sciences 
QA199 .L43 2004X

   *) Chapter 1: nice intro by Pertti Lounesto, a compact version of what's in his "Clifford Algebras and Spinors".
   *) Chapter 3: very opaque treatment of geometric calculus.
   *) Chapter 4: Applications of Clifford Algebras in Physics.  Baylis.
      -- paravector treatment of Lorentz transformations and relativity (including doppler shift)
      -- paravector Lorentz force, and solution of proper time charged particle trajectory.
      -- plane waves treated much like I did.  I used the Gaussian pulse example (Example 39).
      -- Stokes parameters for describing Polarization.
      -- Lienard-Wiechert field (relativistic)
   *) Appendix: Software survey (circa 2004).

Math
QA 199 L68 2001

   *) paravector treatment of Lorentz transformations
   *) Lorentz transformations and transformations of e&m field
   *) F & G GA formulation of maxwells's equations (one dot and one wedge).  nothing much done with them.
   *) energy-momentum tensor in paravector and STA vector forms.
   *) chapter: hypercomplex analysis: GC, Cauchy-Riemann, Stokes, tangent planes, monogenic theory, 

*)

Clifford algebra to geometric calculus : a unified language for mathematics and physics /
by David Hestenes and Garret Sobczyk.
Gerstein Science 
QA199 .H47 1984

   - There's a _lot_ in this book, but it is general, not specifically related to e&m.
     Some interesting stuff includes the generalizations of Cauchy's theorem to multivectors.
   - The intro material is done very nicely (axiomatic and not confusing), in stark
     contrast to the followup to this book (New Foundations of Classical Mechanics).

*)

Geometric algebra with applications in science and engineering /
Eduardo Bayro Corrochano, Garret Sobczyk, editors.
Boston : Birkhäuser, c2001.
Mathematical Sciences 
QA564 .G463 2001X

   - There are two chapters of this that are relavant to e&m, but one is a subset of Baylis'
     book, and the other a subset of GAFP.

Electrodynamics : a modern geometric approach /

Physics

Multivectors and Clifford algebra in electrodynamics
Bernard Jancewicz.
Gerstein Science   
QC631 .J36 1988

   -- uses non-standard names for bivectors (volutors)
   -- uses hats on bivectors and trivectors (haven't seen anybody else doing that)
   -- re-dimensionalizes maxwells equation, which requires adding in additional spacetime derivative terms for sqrt(mu), sqrt(epsilon)
      to compenstate.  those fall out when those are constant in time and space, but make things more complicated otherwise.
      despite doing this, he then proceeds to work with E,H,D,B instead of his re-dimensionalized e,h,d,b.  This initially gives the impression
      that he is treating cases other than D=epsilon E, B = mu H, but that isn't the case.
   -- ends with an STA treatment with respect to relativity, despite using "paravectors" (like Baylis) in the preceding portion of the book.

   ... more to read, in particular, worked problems.
