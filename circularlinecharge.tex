%\makeexample{Circular line charge.}{example:circularlinecharge:circularlinecharge}{
In this example we look at the electric field for a field observed at the spherical coordinate point \( (r, \theta, \phi) \) due to a line charge density of \( \lambda \) along a circular arc segment \( [a,b] \) in the x-y plane.
This is illustrated in FIXME.
