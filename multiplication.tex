Geometric Algebra defines a multiplication operation for vectors, forming a vector space spanned by all the possible vector products.  This algebra is described by the following small set of axioms

\makeaxiom{Associative multiplication.}{axiom:multiplication:associative}{

The product of any three vectors \(\Ba,\Bb,\Bc\) is associative.

\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:multiplication:160}
\Ba (\Bb \Bc)
= (\Ba \Bb) \Bc
= \Ba \Bb \Bc.
\end{equation*}
}

\makeaxiom{Linearity.}{axiom:multiplication:linear}{
Vector products are linear with respect to addition and subtraction.

\begin{dmath*}\label{eqn:multiplication:180}
\begin{aligned}
(\Ba + 3 \Bb \Bd) \Bc &= \Ba \Bb + 3 \Bb \Bd \Bc \\
\Ba (\Bb \Bd - 2 \Bc) &= \Ba \Bb \Bd - 2 \Ba \Bc.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath*}
}

\makeaxiom{Contraction.}{axiom:multiplication:contraction}{

The square of a vector is the squared length of the vector.

\begin{dmath*}\label{eqn:multiplication:200}
\Ba^2 = \Abs{\Ba}^2.
\end{dmath*}

The notion of length here is metric dependent.  For the problems considered in these notes
it can be assumed that there is an orthonormal Euclidean basis, where the vector length is always positive.
For special relativistic calculations, also of interest in electrodynamics, but not the focus of these notes, the length of a (four-)vector may generally be negative or positive.
}

These axioms are simple enough, but have a rich set of consequences\footnote{Similar to Feynman on gravitation \citep{feynman1963flp} ``... have shall said everything required, for a sufficiently talented mathematician could then deduce all the consequences of these principles.  However, since you are not assumed to be sufficiently talented yet, we shall discuss the consequences in more detail''.}.

The linearity and associativity axioms need little comment, but the contraction property might be surprising.  For one justification of this rule, consider a one dimensional vector space spanned by a single unit vector \( \setlr{ \Be } \).  That span, for real \( x \) is all the values

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multiplication:20}
\Bx = x \Be.
\end{dmath}

FIXME: picture to demonstrate the number line isomorphism.

This vector space is isomorphic with a number line, all the possible real values \( x \).
Given a positive number \( x \), the multiplication rules for real numbers require that \( (\pm x)^2 = x^2 \).
The square of a number provides the (squared) length of the number, its distance from the origin.
The same rule can be imposed for one dimensional vectors,
a requirement that the (squared) distance from the origin equals the square of the vector itself.   Such a rule is consistent with the rules of scalar multiplication, and for the
one dimensional vectors of \cref{eqn:multiplication:20} can be stated as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiplication:40}
\Bx^2 = x^2.
\end{equation}

This contraction axiom, justified or not, has additional implications

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multiplication:80}
x^2
= \Bx^2
= (x \Be)(x \Be)
= x^2 \Be^2.
\end{dmath}

This rule requires the square of a unit (Euclidean) vector to be unity

%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiplication:60}
\boxedEquation{eqn:multiplication:60}{
\Be^2 = 1.
}
%\end{equation}

With this implication noted, now consider the square of a simple two dimensional vector

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gaTutorial:80}
2
=
(\Be_1 + \Be_2)^2
= (\Be_1 + \Be_2)(\Be_1 + \Be_2)
= \Be_1^2 + \Be_2 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2 + \Be_2^2
= 2 + \Be_2 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2.
\end{dmath}

The sum above with both scalar terms and terms that are composed of products of vectors is called a multivector.
A product of two perpendicular vectors (or a sum of such products) is called a bivector, and can be used to represent an oriented plane.
Geometric Algebra allows for sums of scalars, vectors, bivectors, and higher degree products.

Observe that for this identity to hold, the bivector terms must sum to zero.  That is

%\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:multiplication:140}
\boxedEquation{eqn:multiplication:140}{
\Be_1 \Be_2 = -\Be_1 \Be_2.
}
%\end{dmath}

This implies that the product of two orthonormal vectors anticommutes.  In general it is also true that

\maketheorem{Normal anticommutation}{thm:multiplication:anticommutationNormal}{
The product of any two normal vectors \(\Bu\), and \(\Bv\) anticommute.
\begin{equation*}
\Bu \Bv = -\Bv \Bu.
\end{equation*}
