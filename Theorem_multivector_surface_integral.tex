\maketheorem{Multivector surface integral.}{thm:surfaceintegral:100}{
Given an connected surface \( S \) parameterized by two parameters, and multivector functions \( F, G \), the \textit{surface integral} is related to the boundary by
\begin{equation*}
\int_S F d^2\Bx \boldpartial G
= \ointclockwise_{\partial S} F d\Bx G,
\end{equation*}
where \( \partial S \) is the boundary of the surface \( S \).
