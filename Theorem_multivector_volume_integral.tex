Given an connected volume \( V \) parameterized by three parameters for which \( d\Bx_1, d\Bx_2, d\Bx_3 \) is a right handed triple, and multivector functions \( F, G \), a volume integral can be reduced to a surface integral as follows
\begin{equation*}
\int_V F d^3\Bx \lrboldpartial G
= \ointctrclockwise_{\partial V} F d^2\Bx G,
\end{equation*}
where \( \partial V \) is the boundary of the volume \( V \), and \( d^2 \Bx \) is the counterclockwise oriented area element on the boundary of the volume.
In \R{3} with \( d^3 \Bx = I dV \), \( d^2 \Bx = I \ncap dA \), this integral can be written using a scalar volume element
\begin{equation*}
\int_V dV F \lrboldpartial G
= \int_{\partial V} dA F \ncap G,
\end{equation*}
