The dot product has been identified with scalar grade selection.  This motivates a general
multivector dot product definition.

\index{multivector dot product}
\makedefinition{Multivector dot product}{dfn:generalizedDot:100}{
The dot (or inner) product of two multivectors
\( A = \sum_{i = 0}^N \gpgrade{A}{i}, B = \sum_{i = 0}^N \gpgrade{B}{i} \)
is defined as
\begin{equation*}
A \cdot B \equiv
\sum_{i,j = 0}^N \gpgrade{ A_i B_j }{\Abs{i - j}},
\end{equation*}
}

In many cases we are interested only in dot products between pairs of k-vectors.
If \( A, B \) are a k-vectors with grades \( i, j \) respectively, then their dot product is just a single grade selection operation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:generalizedDot:580}
A \cdot B = \gpgrade{ A B }{\Abs{i - j}}.
\end{dmath}

In particular, when the grades of two k-vectors are equal, the dot product is just the scalar selection of their product

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:generalizedDot:580}
A \cdot B = \gpgradezero{ A B }.
\end{dmath}

As a first example, consider a specific vector-bivector dot product

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:generalizedDot:560}
\lr{ \Be_1 + \Be_2 } \cdot \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 + 3 \Be_2 \Be_3 }
=
\gpgradeone{
\lr{ \Be_1 + \Be_2 } \lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 + 3 \Be_2 \Be_3 }
}
=
\gpgradeone{
\Be_1^2 \Be_2 + 3 \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3
+
\Be_2^2 \lr{ -\Be_1 + 3 \Be_3 }
}
=
\gpgradeone{
\Be_2 + 3 \cancel{\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3}
-
\Be_1 + 3 \Be_3
}
=
\Be_2 - \Be_1 + 3 \Be_3.
\end{dmath}

Observe that the vector-bivector dot product selects only products with common factors, since any others are trivectors.
