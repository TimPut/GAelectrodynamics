In conventional electromagnetism Maxwell's equations are posed in terms of separate divergence and curl equations.  It is therefore desirable to show that the divergence and curl of a function and it's normal characteristics on the boundary of an integraion volume determine that function uniquely.  This is known as the Helmholtz theorem
\maketheorem{Helmholtz first theorem.}{thm:helmholtzDerviationMultivectorStatement:1}{
If vector \(\BM\) is defined by its divergence

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:helmholtzDerviationMultivectorStatement:20}
\spacegrad \cdot \BM = s
\end{dmath}

and its curl
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:helmholtzDerviationMultivectorStatement:40}
\spacegrad \cross \BM = \BC
\end{dmath}

within a region and its normal component \( \BM_{\txtn} \) over the boundary, then \( \BM \) is
uniquely specified.

It could be argued that Helmholtz's theorem is irrelavent when using the GA formalism, since we consolidate the separate divergence and curl equations into one gradient operator.
We include a proof here regardless, since it can be performed in a compact and interesting fashion using
the fundamental theorem of geometric calculus \cref{thm:fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus:1}.
