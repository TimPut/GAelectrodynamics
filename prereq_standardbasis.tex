In relativisitic geometric algebra, the positive definite property of \cref{dfn:prerequisites:dotproduct} is considered optional.
In this case, the definition of length must be modified, and one would say the length of a vector \( \Bx \) is \( \sqrt{\Abs{\Bx \cdot \Bx}} \), and that \( \Bx \) is a unit vector if \( \Bx \cdot \Bx = \pm 1 \).
Such relativisitic bases will not be used in this book, but it is worth knowing that the geometric algebra literature may use a weaker defition of dot product than typical.
A vector space
with such a weakened dot product is called Euclidean if \( \Be_i \cdot \Be_j = \delta_{ij} \) for all standard basis elements \( \Be_i, \Be_j \), whereas is it non-Euclidean if \( \Be_i \cdot \Be_i = -1 \) for at least one standard basis vector \( \Be_i \).
Because the dot product is bilinear, it is
specified completely by the dot products of a set of basis elements for the space.
For example,
given a basis \( \setlr{ \Bx_1, \Bx_2, \cdots, \Bx_N} \), and two vectors
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:prereq_standardbasis:240}
\begin{aligned}
   \Ba &= \sum_{i = 1}^N a_i \Bx_i \\
   \Bb &= \sum_{i = 1}^N b_i \Bx_i,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
the dot product of the two is
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:prereq_standardbasis:260}
\Ba \cdot \Bb
=
   \lr{ \sum_{i = 1}^N a_i \Bx_i } \cdot
   \lr{ \sum_{j = 1}^N b_j \Bx_j }
=
   \sum_{i,j = 1}^N a_i b_j \lr{ \Bx_i \cdot \Bx_j }.
\end{dmath}
Such an expansion in coordinates can be written in matrix form as
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:prereq_standardbasis:280}
\Ba \cdot \Bb
=
\Ba^\T G \Bb,
\end{dmath}
where \( G \) is the symmetric matrix with elements \( g_{ij} = \Bx_i \cdot \Bx_j \).
This matrix \( G \), or its elements \( g_{ij} \) is also called the metric for the space, with respect to the basis \( \setlr{ \Bx_1, \Bx_2, \cdots, \Bx_N} \).

%For Euclidean spaces, which are the primary focus of this book, the metric is not only diagonal, but is the identity matrix.
%Slightly more general metrics are of interest in electrodynamics.  In particular, a four dimensional (relativistic) vector space, where the metric has diagonals \( (1,-1,-1,-1) \) or \( (-1, 1,1,1) \) allows for the construction of a geometric algebra that allows Maxwell's equations to take their very simplest form.  Such a metric does not have the (Euclidean) positive definite property \( \Bx^\T G \Bx > 0, \Bx \ne 0 \).
