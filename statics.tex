\subsection{Conditions.}
Similar to electrostatics and magnetostatics, we can restrict attention to time invariant fields (\( \partial_t F = 0\)) and time invariant sources (\(\partial_t J = 0\)), but consider both electric and magnetic sources.  In that case Maxwell's equation is reduced to a first order gradient equation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics:20}
\spacegrad F(\Bx) = J(\Bx)
\end{dmath}

Using the Green's function for the (first order) gradient \cref{eqn:electrostatics:260}, this can be inverted as

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics:40}
\BF(\Bx)
= \int_V dV' G(\Bx, \Bx') \spacegrad' \BF(\Bx')
= \gpgrade{\int_V dV' G(\Bx, \Bx') \spacegrad' \BF(\Bx')}{1,2}
= \inv{4\pi} \gpgrade{\int_V dV' \frac{(\Bx - \Bx') J(\Bx')}{\Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}^3} }{1,2}.
\end{dmath}

Like we did in magnetostatics, a no-op grade selection has been inserted to simplify subsequent manipulation.  Moving the grade selection into the integral to tidy things up, the solution to the statics Maxwell equation is

\boxedEquation{eqn:statics:80}{
\BF(\Bx)
= \inv{4\pi} \int_V dV' \frac{\gpgrade{(\Bx - \Bx') J(\Bx')}{1,2}}{\Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}^3}.
}

To relate this to the conventional solution, an expansion of the grade selection is required.  With \( \Bs = \Bx -\Bx' \) that grade selection has the following structure

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics:60}
\gpgrade{\Bs J}{1,2}
=
\eta \gpgrade{\Bs (v \rho - \BJ)}{1,2}
+
\gpgrade{\Bs I(v \rho_m - \BM)}{1,2}
=
\inv{\epsilon} \Bs \rho + \eta \BJ \wedge \Bs + \Bs v \rho_m I + \Bs \cross \BM,
\end{dmath}

so the solution \( F = \BE + \eta I \BH \) to the Maxwell statics equation in terms of the charge and current densities, and electric and magnetic fields is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics:100}
\begin{aligned}
\BE(\Bx)
&=
\inv{4\pi} \int_V dV' \inv{\Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}^3}
\lr{
   \frac{(\Bx - \Bx') \rho(\Bx'))}{\epsilon}
   + 
   (\Bx - \Bx') \cross \BM(\Bx') 
} \\
\BH(\Bx)
&=
\inv{4\pi} \int_V dV' \inv{\Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}^3}
\lr{
  \BJ(\Bx') \cross (\Bx - \Bx')
+ \inv{\mu} (\Bx - \Bx') \rho_m(\Bx')
}.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

It will be preferable to work with combined fields and densities, so that the solution can be left in its simpler form \cref{eqn:statics:80}.
