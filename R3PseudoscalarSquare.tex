As with the use of the symbol \( i \) for the \R{2} pseudoscalar, it is not a coincidence that \( I \) was used 
for the 
\R{3} pseudoscalar.  It is also true that 
\( I = \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \) behaves like a complex imaginary with \( I^2 = -1 \).  This follows 
directly from repeated anticommutation

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:projectionAndRejection:1140}
I^2
=
(\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3)(\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3)
=
\Be_1 \Be_2 (\Be_3 \Be_1) \Be_2 \Be_3
=
\Be_1 \Be_2 (-\Be_1 \Be_3) \Be_2 \Be_3
=
-\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_1 (\Be_3 \Be_2) \Be_3
=
-\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_1 (-\Be_2 \Be_3) \Be_3
=
+\Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_1 \Be_2 (\Be_3 \Be_3)
=
(\Be_1 \Be_2)^2
=
-1.
\end{dmath}
