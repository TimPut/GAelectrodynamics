\maketheorem{Plane wave solutions to Maxwell's equation.}{thm:planewavesMultivector:620}{
Single frequency \textit{plane wave solutions of Maxwell's equation} have the form
\begin{equation*}
F(\Bx, t)
=
\Real \lr{
\lr{ 1 + \kcap }
\kcap \wedge \BE\,
e^{-j \Bk \cdot \Bx + j \omega t}
}
,
\end{equation*}
where \( \Norm{\Bk} = \omega/c \), \( \kcap = \Bk/\Norm{\Bk} \) is the unit vector pointing along the propagation direction, and \( \BE \) is any complex-valued vector variable.
When a \( \BE \cdot \Bk = 0 \) constraint is imposed on the vector variable \( \BE \), that variable can be interpreted as the electric field, and the solution reduces to
\begin{equation*}
F(\Bx, t)
=
\Real \lr{
\lr{ 1 + \kcap }
\BE\,
e^{-j \Bk \cdot \Bx + j \omega t}
}
,
\end{equation*}
showing that the field phasor \( F(\Bk) = \BE(\Bk) + I \eta \BH(\Bk) \) splits naturally into electric and magnetic components
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\BE(\Bk) &= \BE\, e^{-j \Bk \cdot \Bx} \\
\eta \BH(\Bk) &= \kcap \cross \BE \, e^{-j \Bk \cdot \Bx},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where the directions \( \kcap, \BE, \BH \) form a right handed triple.
