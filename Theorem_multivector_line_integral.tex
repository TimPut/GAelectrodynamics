\maketheorem{Multivector line integral.}{thm:lineintegral:100}{
Given an connected curve \( C \) parameterized by a single parameter, and multivector functions \( F, G \), the \textit{line integral} is related to the boundary by
\begin{equation*}
\int_C F d^1\Bx \boldpartial G
= \evalbar{F G}{\Delta a}.
\end{equation*}
