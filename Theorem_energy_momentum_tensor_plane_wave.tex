\maketheorem{Energy momentum tensor components for a plane wave.}{thm:polarizationRewrite:780}{
The \textit{energy momentum tensor components} for the plane wave given by \cref{eqn:polarizationRewrite:760} are
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
T(1) &= -T(\Be_3) = \epsilon \lr{ 1 + \Be_3 } f f^\dagger \quad \lr{ = \calE + \frac{\BS}{c} } \\
T(\Be_1) &= T(\Be_2) = 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
