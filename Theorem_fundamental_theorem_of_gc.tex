Given
multivectors \(F, G \),
a parameterization \( \Bx = \Bx(u_1, u_2, \cdots) \), with hypervolume element \( d^k \Bx = d^k u I_k \), where
\( I_k = \Bx_1 \wedge \Bx_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge \Bx_k \), the hypervolume integral is related to the boundary integral by
\begin{equation*}
\int_V F d^k \Bx \lrboldpartial G = \int_{\partial V} F d^{k-1} \Bx G,
\end{equation*}
where \( \partial V \) represents the boundary of the volume, and \( d^{k-1} \Bx \) is the hypersurface element.
This is called the \textit{Fundamental theorem of geometric calculus}.

The hypersurface element and boundary integral is defined for \( k > 1 \) as
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\partial V} F d^{k-1} \Bx G
\equiv
\sum_i \int d^{k-1} u_i \evalbar{ \lr{ F \lr{ I_k \cdot \Bx^i} G }}{\Delta u_i},
\end{equation*}
where \( d^{k-1} u_i \) is the product of all \( du_j \) except for \( du_i \).
For
\( k = 1 \) the hypersurface element and associated
boundary ``integral''
is really just convenient general shorthand, and
should be taken to mean the evaluation of the \( F G \) multivector product over the range of the parameter
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\partial V} F d^{0} \Bx G
\equiv
\evalbar{ F G }{\Delta u_1}.
\end{equation*}
