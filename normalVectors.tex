An interchange of the order of the factors of two orthogonal factors results in a change of sign,
for example \( \Be_2 \Be_1 = -\Be_1 \Be_2 \).
This is a consequence of the contraction axiom, and can be demonstrated by squaring the vector
\( \Be_1 + \Be_2 \) (\cref{fig:unitSum:unitSumFig1}).

\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/unitSumFig1}{\( \Be_1 + \Be_2 \).}{fig:unitSum:unitSumFig1}{0.3}
By the contraction axiom, the square of this vector is \( 2 \), so we have
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:normalVectors:80}
2 =
(\Be_1 + \Be_2)^2
= (\Be_1 + \Be_2)(\Be_1 + \Be_2)
= \Be_1^2 + \Be_2^2 + \Be_2 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2.
= 2 + \Be_2 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2.
\end{dmath}

We conclude immediately that
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:normalVectors:280}
\Be_2 \Be_1 + \Be_1 \Be_2 = 0,
\end{dmath}
or
%\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:normalVectors:140}
\boxedEquation{eqn:normalVectors:140}{
\Be_1 \Be_2 = -\Be_1 \Be_2.
}
%\end{dmath}

The same computation could have been performed for any two orthogonal vectors, so we conclude that any interchange of two orthogonal vectors changes the sign.

\maketheorem{Anticommutation}{thm:multiplication:anticommutationNormal}{
Let \(\Bu\), and \(\Bv\) be two orthogonal vectors, the product of which \( \Bu \Bv \) is a bivector.
Changing the order of these products toggles the sign of the bivector.
\begin{equation*}
\Bu \Bv = -\Bv \Bu.
\end{equation*}

This sign change on interchange is called anticommutation.  Conversely, if the product of two vectors is a bivector, those vectors are orthogonal.
