\section{Conventional differential form}

The differential form of Maxwell's equations, with extensions for magnetic sources, is the starting point for all the analysis in these notes.  Those equations are

\input{../ece1229-antenna/MaxwellsStatement.tex}

The magnetic sources can be considered fictional, and are included because they are useful in antenna theory to model real phenomina such as infinitesimal current loops.

\input{../ece1229-antenna/MaxwellsFieldAndSourceDescription.tex}

These fields and sources are all real valued.  In many situations it will be desirable to work with a time harmonic (frequency-domain phasor) form of Maxwell's equations.  In engineering, a time harmonic representation presumes that all sources and fields have a frequency dependence of the form
\index{time harmonic}

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:20}
\bcY(\Bx, t) = \Real( \BY(\Bx, \omega) e^{j\omega t} ),
\end{dmath}

where the field (or source) \( \BY(\Bx, \Bomega) \) is allowed to be complex valued, whereupon Maxwell's equations take the form

\input{../ece1229-antenna/MaxwellsTimeHarmonic.tex}

Note that the time harmonic convention typically used in physics literature presumes a frequency dependence of the form

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:40}
\bcY(\Bx, t) = \Real( \BY(\Bx, \omega) e^{-i\omega t} ),
\end{dmath}

which alters the sign of any imaginary originating from a time derivative.  Care is required by the reader to understand which form of frequency dependence has been assumed.

\section{GA differential form}

Geometric Algebra admits a number of alternative representations of Maxwell's equations.  The first follows from expressing the cross products all as wedge products, leaving a pair of bivector and a pair of scalar equations

\begin{subequations}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:60}
\spacegrad \wedge \bcE = - I \bcM - \PD{t}{I\bcB}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:80}
\spacegrad \wedge \bcH = I \bcJ + I \PD{t}{\bcD}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:100}
\spacegrad \cdot \bcD = q_\txte
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:120}
\spacegrad \cdot \bcB = q_\txtm.
\end{dmath}
\end{subequations}

Alternatively, the duality transformation \( \Ba \wedge \Bb = -I \Ba \cdot (I \Bb) \) allows Maxwell's equations to be all written as dot products

\begin{subequations}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:140}
\spacegrad \cdot (I \bcE) = \bcM + \PD{t}{\bcB}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:160}
\spacegrad \cdot (I \bcH) = -\bcJ - \PD{t}{\bcD}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:180}
\spacegrad \cdot \bcD = q_\txte
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:200}
\spacegrad \cdot \bcB = q_\txtm,
\end{dmath}
\end{subequations}

or, using the duality transformation \( \Ba \cdot \Bb = -I (\Ba \wedge (I \Bb) \), Maxwell's equations can all be written as wedge products

\begin{subequations}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:220}
\spacegrad \wedge \bcE = - I \bcM - \PD{t}{I\bcB}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:240}
\spacegrad \wedge \bcH = I \bcJ + I \PD{t}{\bcD}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:260}
\spacegrad \wedge (I\bcD) = I q_\txte
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:280}
\spacegrad \wedge (I\bcB) = I q_\txtm.
\end{dmath}
\end{subequations}

Each of these forms can be useful in different circumstances, however the real power of GA in electromagnetism follows from presuming constituative relationships between the pairs of electric and magnetic fields

\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:300}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:320}
\bcB = \mu \bcH
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:340}
\bcD = \epsilon \bcE,
\end{dmath}
\end{subequations}

where \( \epsilon \) is the permitivitity of the medium [\si{F/m}] (Farads/meter), and \( \mu \) is the permeability of the medium [\si{H/m}] (Henries/meter).
The permitivitity and permeability may be functions of both time and position, and model the materials that the fields are propagating through.  In general, the these may be non-isotropic tensor operators, however, unless otherwise specified, isotropic media will be assumed in these notes.

With this constitutative relationship assumed (and a bit of rescaling), the dot and wedge products of \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:60}, \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:100} can be added, as can those of \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:80}, \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:120}.  This reduces Maxwell's equations to a pair of first order coupled gradient equations

\begin{subequations}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:360}
\spacegrad \bcE = \inv{\epsilon} q_\txte - I \bcM - \mu \PD{t}{(I\bcH)}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:380}
\spacegrad (I \bcH) = \frac{I q_\txtm}{\mu} - \bcJ - \epsilon \PD{t}{\bcE}.
\end{dmath}
\end{subequations}
