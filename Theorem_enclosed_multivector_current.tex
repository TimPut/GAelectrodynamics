\maketheorem{Enclosed multivector current.}{thm:enclosedCurrent:60}{
The \textit{enclosed multivector current} in the volume is related to the surface integral of \( \ncap F \) over the boundary of the volume by
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\partial V} dA \ncap F = \int_V dV J.
\end{equation*}
This is a multivector equation, carrying information for each grade in the multivector current, and after explicit expansion is equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cdot \BE        &=  \inv{\epsilon} \int_V dV\, \rho \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cross \BH       &=                 \int_V dV\, \BJ \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cross \BE       &=               - \int_V dV\, \BM \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cdot \BH        &=  \inv{\mu} \int_V dV\, \rho_\txtm.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
