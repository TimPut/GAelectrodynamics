Geometric algebra (GA for short), generalizes and extends vector algebra.  Because vector algebra is the foundation for GA, it is worthwhile to systematically review some of that foundation.  In particular, we want to review the concepts of vector space, basis, and orthonormality.

While most of the following should be review, please take note of the unconventional definition of dot product used in GA, which does not require the dot product of a vector with itself to be positive.
