\generatetitle{Project report ECE2500.  Geometric Algebra for Electrical Engineers}

\section{Motivation.}
This is the report for an ECE2500 M.Eng project course.

\subsection{Goals.}
This project had a few goals
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a literature review of applications of geometric algebra
to the study of electromagnetism.
\item Identify the subset of the literature that had direct relevance to electrical engineering.
\item Create a complete, and as compact as possible, introduction of the prerequisites required
for a graduate or advanced undergraduate electrical engineering student to be able to apply
geometric algebra to problems in electromagnetism.
%\item Develop some computer algebra methods for geometric algebra manipulation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What is geometric algebra?}

Geometric algebra
generalizes vectors, providing algebraic representations of not just directed line segments, but also points, plane segments, volumes, and higher degree geometric objects (hypervolumes.)
The geometric algebra representation of planes, volumes and hypervolumes requires a vector dot product, a vector multiplication operation, and a generalized addition operation.
The dot product
provides the length of a vector and a test for whether or not any two vectors are perpendicular.
The vector multiplication operation is used to construct
directed plane segments (bivectors),
and directed volumes (trivectors), which are built from the respective products of two or three mutually perpendicular vectors.
The addition operation allows for sums of scalars, vectors, or any products of vectors.  Such a sum is called a multivector.

The power to add scalars, vectors, and products of vectors can be exploited to simplify much of electromagnetism.
In particular, Maxwell's equations for isotropic media can be merged into a single multivector equation
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:quaternion2maxwellWithGA:20}
\stgrad \lr{ \BE + I c \BB } = \eta\lr{ c \rho - \BJ },
\end{dmath}
where \( \spacegrad \) is the gradient, \( I = \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \) is the ordered product of the three \R{3} basis vectors, \( c = 1/\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}\) is the group velocity of the medium, \( \eta = \sqrt{\mu/\epsilon} \), \( \BE, \BB \) are the electric and magnetic fields, and
\( \rho \) and \( \BJ \) are the charge and current densities.
We will write this as
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:ece2500report:40}
\stgrad F = J,
\end{dmath}
where \( F = \BE + I c \BB \) is the combined (multivector) electromagnetic field, and \( J = \eta\lr{ c \rho - \BJ } \) is the multivector current.
As a single PDE, the complete Green's function toolbox may be thrown at
\cref{eqn:ece2500report:40}, inverting Maxwell's equation for the electromagnetic field, given any charge and current density distribution
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:ece2500report:60}
F(\Bx, t)
= \int dt' dV' G(\Bx, \Bx' ; t, t') J(\Bx', t').
\end{dmath}
Green's functions may also be applied to static and frequency domain field configurations.
Solving for, or working with, the combined field \( F \) shows the
hidden structure behind a number of seemingly
disparate ideas in electromagnetism.
This project explored a number of ideas along these lines.
For example, a
Green's function solutions for the static field configurations simultaneously yields Coulomb's and the Biot-Savart law.
Plane, circular and elliptical waves may be expressed compactly in a multivector form, naturally expressing the mutual perpendicularity of the electric field, magnetic field and the propagation directions, as well
as the relationships between the electric and magnetic field components.
The field energy density and Poynting vectors have a simple multivector form expressed in terms of \( F \) alone.
Calculations of radiation pressure can be performed using only the normal component of what is known as the energy momentum tensor in the conventional representation, which has a particularly compact multivector
representation.

It is my belief that systematically working through all of the introductory and advanced topics in electromagnetism using geometric algebra would provide significant insight, as well as a new set of powerful tools and procedures of practical value to the electrical engineer or physics practitioner.

\subsection{Results.}

Much of the geometric algebra literature for electrodynamics is presented with a relativistic bias, or assumes high levels of mathematical or physics sophistication.
The aim of this work was an attempt to make the study of electromagnetism using geometric algebra more accessible, especially to an electrical engineering audience.
In particular, this project explored non-relativistic applications of geometric algebra to electromagnetism.
The end product of this project was a fairly small self contained book, titled ``Geometric Algebra for Electrical Engineers''.
This book includes an introduction to Euclidean geometric algebra focused on \R{2} and \R{3} (64 pages), an introduction to geometric calculus and multivector Green's functions (64 pages), applications to electromagnetism (82 pages), and some appendices.

Many of the fundamental results of electromagnetism are derived directly from
\cref{eqn:ece2500report:40}, the multivector Maxwell's equation, in a streamlined and compact fashion.
This includes some new results, and many of the existing non-relativistic results from the geometric algebra literature.
As a
conceptual bridge, the book includes many examples of how to extract
familiar conventional results from simpler multivector representations.
Also included in the book are some sample calculations exploiting unique capabilities that geometric algebra provides.
In particular, vectors in a plane may be manipulated much like complex numbers, which has a number of advantages over working with coordinates explicitly.

The book produced in this project provides the prerequisite material for such exploration, and some first steps along the path of such an expedition.

\section{This report.}

This report summarizes some results from the book, omitting all figures, citations, Mathematica listings\footnote{Using Mathematica modules developed in this project, and other existing Mathematica modules.}, details from worked examples, and (most) explainations and derivations.
This report attempts to provide an overview that may be used as a road map for the book for further exploration, but unfortunately due to space constraints cannot actually explain the material in any meaningful way.

\section{Chapter I: Geometric Algebra.}
This chapter of the book attempted a self contained introduction to geometric algebra, with all the prerequisites required for geometric calculus and the subsequent applications to electromagnetism.
Due to space constraints in this report, no attempt to summarize that introduction will be made here.

\section{Chapter II: Geometric Calculus.}

There were two goals of this chapter.
The first was to present the theory of multivector integration along curves and surfaces, and the second was to derive all the Green's functions required for electromagnetism.
The multivector integration theory incorporates all of vector calculus as well as the more abstract theory of differential forms or integration on manifolds, but also generalizes both.
The key ideas of this chapter will be summarized below.
The book contains derivations, many examples, figures, Mathematica listings, and detailed explaination of many of the ideas summarized here.

\subsection{Reciprocal frames.}
In order to work with the
curvilinear non-orthonormal bases that will be encountered in general integration theory, the concept of a reciprocal frame is required.

\input{Definition_reciprocal_frame.tex}

Note that any orthonormal basis is also its reciprocal basis.
As also done in tensor and relativistic theory, we use mixed index (upper and lower) variables when working with curvilinear coordinates.
Summation (Einstein) convention was not used in the book, and all sums that could be implied by appropriately mixed indexes quantities are marked with an explicit summation symbol.

A vector may be expressed in terms of either the curvilinear or reciprocal basis
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece2500report:n}
\Ba
= \sum_i \lr{ \Ba \cdot \Bx^i } \Bx_i
= \sum_i \lr{ \Ba \cdot \Bx_i } \Bx^i,
\end{equation}
showing that reciprocal frame can be used to compute the coordinates of a vector in the curvilinear basis and the curvilinear basis can be used to compute the coordinates with respect to the reciprocal basis.
Because we never use coordinates \( a_i = \Ba \cdot \Bx_i, a^i = \Ba \cdot \Bx^i \) isolated from the associated basis, we have no need of the covariant nor contravariant tensor nomenclature.
The book contains a number of examples of reciprocal frames, methods of computation, Mathematica examples, and other related concepts including computation of coordinates of higher grade blades with respect to curvilinear coordinates.

\subsection{Curvilinear coordinates and hypervolume elements.}
Curvilinear coordinates can be defined for any subspace spanned by a parameterized vector into that space.
In the book we use one, two or three parameter bases.
For a vector parameterization \( \Bx(u_1, u_2, u_3) \) we define the curvilinear basis elements \( \Bx_i = \PDi{u_i}{\Bx} \), and associated vector valued differentials \( d\Bx_i = \Bx_i du_i \).
Bivector valued area elements \( d^2 \Bx \equiv d\Bx_1 \wedge d\Bx_2 \) are formed by wedging the two vector differentials for a two parameter manifold,
whereas trivector valued volume elements  \( d^3 \Bx \equiv d\Bx_1 \wedge d\Bx_2 \wedge d\Bx_3 \)
are formed by wedging all three of the differentials for the parameterized space.
Such hypervolume elements have an orientation, as changing the order of any two differentials toggles the sign.
As the book is concerned primarily with Euclidean spaces, the absolute values of such area and volume differentials are \( \sqrt{-\lr{ d^2 \Bx}^2}, \sqrt{-\lr{ d^3 \Bx}^3 } \), which are the respective areas and volumes of the paralellogram and paralellopiped spanned by the vector differentials in each of the parameterization directions.

The book contains examples, figures, Mathematica calculations, and discussion that elaborates and explains these concepts in detail.

\subsection{Gradient and vector derivative.}

The final tool required to formulate multivector integration theory is the vector derivative, the projection of the gradient onto the integration manifold.

\input{Theorem_reciprocal_frame_vectors_gradient.tex}

\input{Theorem_curvilinear_gradient.tex}

\input{Definition_vector_derivative.tex}

In general the gradient contains the vector derivative and we can write \( \spacegrad = \boldpartial + \spacegrad_\perp \), but
 when the dimension of the subspace (number of parameters) equals the dimension of the underlying vector space, the vector derivative and gradient are identical.
We may think of the vector derivative as the projection of the gradient onto the tangent space at the point of evaluation.

In the book many many examples, figures, and Mathematica calculations are used to illustrate and explain the vector derivative and associated curvilinear parameterizations.
This includes calculations of curvilinear coordinates, area and volume elements, and the vector derivative
for polar, spherical and a toroidal coordinate systems.

\subsection{Integration theory.}
The generalization of line, surface and volume integrals to hypervolumes and multivector functions can now be stated.

\input{Definition_multivector_integral.tex}

The vector derivative
may not commute with \( F, G \) nor the volume element \( d^k \Bx \), so we are forced to use some notation to indicate what the vector derivative (or gradient) acts on.
In conventional right acting cases, where there is no ambiguity, arrows will usually be omitted, but braces may also be used to indicate the scope of derivative operators.
This bidirectional notation will also be used for the gradient, especially for volume integrals in \R{3} where the vector derivative is identitical to the gradient.

Some authors use the Hestenes dot notation, with overdots or primes to indicatating the exact scope of multivector derivative operators, as in
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus:260}
\dot{F} d^k \Bx \dot{\boldpartial} \dot{G} =
\dot{F} d^k \Bx \dot{\boldpartial} G
+
F d^k \Bx \dot{\boldpartial} \dot{G}.
\end{dmath}
The dot notation has the advantage of emphasizing that the action of the vector derivative (or gradient) is on the functions \( F, G \), and not on the hypervolume element \( d^k \Bx \).
However, in the book, where primed operators such as \( \spacegrad' \) are used to indicate that derivatives are taken with respect to primed \( \Bx' \) variables, a mix of dots and ticks would have been confusing.

\input{Theorem_fundamental_theorem_of_gc.tex}

The fundamental theorem of geometric calculus is a generalization of many conventional scalar and vector integral theorems, and relates a hypervolume integral to its boundary.
This is a a powerful theorem, which we will use with Green's functions to solve Maxwell's equation, but also to derive the geometric algebra form of Stokes' theorem, from which most of the familiar integral calculus results follow.

The book includes a proof of
\cref{thm:fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus:1} in the appendix, however, to make the material more accessible, this theorem is stated and proven separately in the book for each of the
line, surface, and volume integral cases respectively.

\subsubsection{Stokes' theorem.}
An important consequence of the fundamental theorem of geometric calculus is the
geometric algebra generalization of Stokes' theorem.
The Stokes' theorem that we know from conventional vector calculus relates
\R{3} surface integrals to the line integral around a bounding surface.
The geometric algebra form of Stokes' theorem is equivalent to Stokes' theorem from the theory of differential forms, which relates
hypervolume integrals of blades\footnote{Blades are isomorphic to the k-forms found in the theory of differential forms.} to the integrals over their hypersurface boundaries, a much more general result.

\input{Theorem_stokes_theorem_general.tex}

In the book we will see that most of the well known scalar and vector integral theorems can easily be derived as direct consequences of \cref{thm:stokesTheoremGeometricAlgebra:1740}, itself a special case of \cref{thm:fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus:1}.  In this report we state those results for the special cases of line, area and volume integrals.

\input{Theorem_multivector_line_integral.tex}

\input{Theorem_line_integral_scalar_function.tex}

\input{Theorem_multivector_surface_integral.tex}

\input{Theorem_surface_integral_of_scalar_stokes.tex}

\input{Theorem_surface_integral_of_vector_stokes.tex}

\input{Theorem_greens.tex}

\input{Theorem_multivector_volume_integral.tex}

\input{Theorem_volume_integral_of_vector_stokes.tex}

\input{Theorem_volume_integral_of_bivector_stokes_divergence.tex}

\input{Theorem_divergence.tex}

Note \cref{thm:volumeintegral:2661} does not apply to any multivectors \( M \) with pseudoscalar components.

\subsection{Multivector Fourier transform and phasors.}
The book makes use of time harmonic (frequency domain) representations when convienient.
Provided we utilize a scalar (non-geometric) imaginary, a standard Fourier transform generalizes to multivectors without trouble.

\input{Definition_multivector_fourier.tex}

The book uses the engineering convention for
phasors, with a positive sign on the angular frequency complex exponentials.

\input{Definition_multivector_phasor.tex}

The complex valued multivector \( F(\Bx) \) is still generated from the real Euclidean basis for \R{3}, so there will be
no reason to introduce complex inner products spaces into the mix.

\subsection{Multivector Green's functions.}
An attempt to motivate the concept of a Green's function is provided in the book, omitted here.
Also detailed in the book are the sign conventions chosen for our Green's functions, which vary in the literature and discussion of bounded vs unbounded integration volumes and some theorems related to bounded applications of Green's functions (Green's theorem, and a related identity for the (first order) gradient.)

\input{Theorem_greens_function_helmholtz_report.tex}

We will use the advancing (causal) Green's function, and refer to this function as \( G(\Bx, \Bx') \) without any subscript.
Observe that as a special case, the Helmholtz Green's function reduces to the Green's function for the Laplacian when \( k = 0 \)
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:greensFunctionHelmholtz:80}
G(\Bx, \Bx') = -\inv{ 4 \pi \Norm{\Bx - \Bx'}}.
\end{dmath}

The Helmholtz operator can be factored in geometric algebra as \( \spacegrad^2 + k^2 = \lr{ \spacegrad \pm j k }\lr{ \spacegrad \mp j k } \).
We will call these factors first order Helmholtz operators, and derive their (multivector valued) Green's functions, which are as follows.
\input{Theorem_greens_function_helmholtz_first_order.tex}

This theorem is proven in the book from the Green's function for the (second order) Helmholtz operator.
The solution of the
the first order Helmholtz system \( \lr{ \spacegrad + j k } F = J \) follows immediately
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:greensFunctionFirstOrderHelmholtz:880}
F(\Bx)
=
\int_V G(\Bx, \Bx') J(\Bx') dV'
-
\int_{\partial V} G(\Bx, \Bx') \ncap' F(\Bx') dA'
+ F_0,
\end{dmath}
where \( F_0 \) is a solution to the homogeneous first order Helmholtz equation \( \lr{ \spacegrad + j k } F_0 = 0 \).

A special but important case of \cref{thm:gradientGreensFunctionEuclidean:720}
is the \( k = 0 \) condition, which provides the
Green's function for the gradient, which is vector valued
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:greensFunctionFirstOrderHelmholtz:900}
G(\Bx, \Bx' ; k = 0) = \inv{4 \pi} \frac{\rcap}{r^2}.
\end{equation}

For the wave equation operator, it is helpful to introduce a d'Lambertian operator.  Because the sign of this operator varies in the literature, we must state our choice explicitly.
\input{Definition_wave_equation_operator.tex}

The d'Lambertian operator may be factored in geometric algebra as \( \dAlembertian = \conjstgradi \stgradi \).
The operator \( \spacegrad + (1/c) \partial_t \) will be called the \textit{spacetime gradient}\footnote{This form of spacetime gradient is given a special symbol by a number of authors, but there is no general agreement on what to use.
Instead of entering the fight, it will be written it out in full in the book.}.

In the book, the Green's function for the spacetime gradient is derived from the from the Green's function for the d'Lambertian, also well known.
\input{Theorem_greens_function_spacetime_grad.tex}
Like the Green's function for the first order Helmholtz operator, the Green's function for the spacetime gradient is also multivector.

\subsection{Helmholtz theorem.}
In the book first and second order proofs of Helmholtz theorem are provided, both using geometric algebra techniques.
Disussion of those derivations are omitted here for brevity.
\section{Chapter III: Electromagnetism.}
\subsection{Conventional Maxwell's equations.}
In the book it is presumed that the reader is familiar with Maxwell's equations, and that no attempt to motivate them is required.
We start with Maxwell's equations with the antenna theory extensions (fictious magnetic sources)
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:ece2500report:2540}
\begin{aligned}
\spacegrad \cross \BE &= - \BM - \PD{t}{\BB} \\
\spacegrad \cross \BH &= \BJ + \PD{t}{\BD} \\
\spacegrad \cdot \BD &= \rho \\
\spacegrad \cdot \BB &= \rho_\txtm.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
where \( \BE, \BH, \BD, \BB \) are the conventional electric and magnetic field intensities and flux densities,
\( \rho, \rho_\txtm \) are the electric and (fictitious-)magnetic charge densities,
and \( \BJ, \BM \) are the electric and (fictitious-)magnetic current densities.
Much of the book presumes isotropic constitutive relationships between the electric and magnetic fields
\begin{dmath}
\label{eqn:freespace:300}
\begin{aligned}
\BB &= \mu \BH \\
\BD &= \epsilon \BE,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
where \( \epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of the medium, and \( \mu = \mu_r \mu_0 \) is the permeability of the medium.  There is some limited discussion of the geometric algebra form of Maxwell's equations for more general media at the end of the book.
\subsection{Maxwell's equation.}
For isotropic media and constitutive relationships \cref{eqn:freespace:300} we may define
a multivector field that includes both electric and magnetic components
\input{Definition_electromagnetic_field_strength.tex}

The factors of \( \eta \) (or \( c \)) that multiply the magnetic fields are for dimensional consistency, since \( [\sqrt{\epsilon} \BE] = [\sqrt{\mu} \BH] = [\BB/\sqrt{\mu}]\).
The justification for imposing a dual (or complex) structure on the electromagnetic field strength can be found in the historical development of
Maxwell's equations, but we will also see such a structure arise naturally in short order.

No information is lost by imposing the complex structure of
\cref{dfn:isotropicMaxwells:640}, since we can always obtain the
electric field vector \( \BE \) and the magnetic field bivector \( I \BH \) by grade selection
from the electromagnetic field strength when desired using \(
\BE = \gpgradeone{ F },
I \BH = (1/\eta) \gpgradetwo{ F } \).

We will also
define a multivector current containing all charge densites and current densities as follows.
\input{Definition_multivector_current.tex}
When fictitious magnetic source terms \((\rho_\txtm, \BM)\) are included, the current has one grade for each possible source (scalar, vector, bivector, trivector).
With only conventional electric sources, the current is still a multivector, but contains only scalar and vector grades.

Given the multivector field and current, it is now possible to state Maxwell's equation (singular) in its geometric algebra form
\input{Definition_maxwells.tex}
Maxwell's equation in this form will be the starting place for all the subsequent analysis in the book.

See the book for a proof of \cref{dfn:isotropicMaxwells:680}.
The workhorse of the proof is the identity \( \spacegrad \Bb = \spacegrad \cdot \Bb + I \spacegrad \cross \Bb \) which allows Maxwell's equations into two gradient equations, one for each of \( \spacegrad \BE \), and \( \spacegrad \BH \), which can then be further grouped to complete the proof.
There is a lot of information packed into this single equation.
Expanded in full it is
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:isotropicMaxwells:580}
\stgrad \lr{ \BE + I \eta \BH } = \eta\lr{ c \rho - \BJ } + I \lr{ c \rho_\txtm - \BM }.
\end{dmath}

\subsection{Wave equation and continuity.}
Some would argue that the conventional form
\cref{eqn:ece2500report:2540}
of Maxwell's equations have built in redundancy since continuity equations on the charge and current densities couple some of these equations.
We will take an opposing view, and show that such continuity equations are neccessary consequences of Maxwell's equation in its wave equation form, and derive those conditions.
This amounts to a statement that the multivector current \( J \) is not completely unconstrained.

\input{Theorem_continuity_wave.tex}

The proof is in the book, but basically just requires operating on Maxwell's equation with \( \conjstgradi \), which yields two equations
equations, one for grades 1,2 and one for grades 0,3
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:continuity:130}
\begin{aligned}
%\lr{ \spacegrad^2 - \inv{c^2} \PDSq{t}{} }
\dAlembertian
F &= \gpgrade{ \conjstgrad J }{1,2} \\
                                           0 &= \gpgrade{ \conjstgrad J }{0,3}.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
The grade 0,3 selection of \cref{eqn:continuity:130} provides the continuity equations.
\subsection{Plane waves.}
With all sources zero,
the free space Maxwell's equation as given by \cref{dfn:isotropicMaxwells:680} for the
electromagnetic field strength reduces to just
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:planewavesMultivector:300}
\stgrad F(\Bx, t) = 0.
\end{dmath}

Utilizing a phasor representation of the form \cref{dfn:greensFunctionOverview:300},
we will define the
phasor representation of the field as
\input{Definition_plane_wave.tex}

In the book, we show that solutions of the electromagnetic field wave equation have the following form.
\input{Theorem_plane_wave_solutions.tex}

A full proof and discussion is in the book.
The key step is that after insertion of the presumed phasor relationship, we find that
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:planewavesMultivector:60}
0
=
-j \lr{ \Bk - \frac{\omega}{c} } F(\Bk),
\end{dmath}
which can be satisfied by insisting that \( F \) has a \( \Bk + \omega/c \) factor and that \( \Norm{\Bk} = \omega/c \).
The observation that
\( \kcap, \BE, \BH \) form a right handed triple, is expressed geometrically by \( I = \kcap \Ecap \Hcap \), from which we can also find \( \kcap = \Ecap \cross \Hcap \).

\subsection{Statics solution.}
If we restrict attention to time invariant fields (\( \partial_t F = 0\)) and time invariant sources (\(\partial_t J = 0\)),
Maxwell's equation is reduced to an invertible first order gradient equation
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:statics:20}
\spacegrad F(\Bx) = J(\Bx),
\end{dmath}

\input{Theorem_maxwell_statics_solution.tex}

We see that the solution incorporates both a {\color{DarkOliveGreen}Coulomb's law} contribution and a {\color{Maroon}Biot-Savart law} contribution, as well as their magnetic source analogues if applicable.

The proof is essentially a convolution with the (vector valued) Green's function for the (first order) gradient \cref{eqn:greensFunctionFirstOrderHelmholtz:900}.
\subsection{Statics: Enclosed charge.}
In conventional electrostatics we obtain a relation between the normal electric field component and the enclosed charge by integrating the electric field divergence.
The geometric algebra generalization of this relates the product of the normal and the electromagnetic field strength related to the enclosed multivector current as follows.
\input{Theorem_enclosed_multivector_current.tex}

To prove \cref{thm:enclosedCurrent:60} one evaluate the volume integral of the gradient of the field using \cref{thm:volumeintegral:100}.
The rest of the proof follows by grade selection.
For full details on both see the book.
\subsection{Statics: Enclosed current.}
Ampere's law may be generalized to line integrals of the total electromagnetic field strength.
\input{Theorem_line_integral_of_field.tex}
Flipping the direction of integration in the the last of the scalar equations in
\cref{thm:amperes:280}
provides the conventional form of Ampere's law
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:amperes:20}
\ointctrclockwise_{\partial A} d\Bx \cdot \BH = \int_A \ncap \cdot \BJ = I_{\textrm{enc}}.
\end{equation}
%and the first is the dual of Ampere's law for (fictious) magnetic current density\footnote{Even without the fictitious magnetic sources, neither the name nor applications of the two cross product line integrals with the normal derivatives are familiar to the author.}.
%In \cref{eqn:amperes:20} the flux of the electric current density equals the enclosed current flowing through an open surface.
%This enclosed current equals the line integral of the magnetic field around the boundary of that surface.
The proof and additional details can be found in the book.

It is worth pointing out that for pure magnetostatics problems where \( J = \eta \BJ, F = I \eta \BH \), that Ampere's law can be written in a trivector form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:amperes:260}
\ointclockwise_{\partial A} d\Bx \wedge F = I \int_A dA\, \ncap \cdot J = I \eta \int_A dA\, \ncap \cdot \BJ.
\end{equation}
This encodes the fact that the magnetic field component of the total electromagnetic field strength is most naturally expressed in
geometric algebra as a bivector.

\subsection{Statics: Example field calculations.}
A number of worked examples were calculated to illustrate geometric algebra techniques.
\begin{itemize}
\item A finite line charge with line charge density \( \lambda \).
With \( i = \Be_1 \Be_3 \), the (electric) field is found to have the form \( F = (\lambda/r) \int du \lr{ e^{i\theta} - u } f(u) \), where
\( f(u) \) is a scalar function (specified in the book.)
The scalar portion of the integral is strictly a scale factor for the component of the field that lies along the x-axis, whereas the ``complex exponential'' factor of the integrand represents a rotational term along the direction \( \Be_1 e^{i\theta} = \Be_1 \cos\theta + \Be_3 \sin\theta \).
In problems like this, with only two degrees of freedom, there will often be a complex like representation possible using geometric algebra.
%This is illustrated in \cref{fig:linecharge:linechargeFig1}.
%\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/linechargeFig1}{Line charge density.}{fig:linecharge:linechargeFig1}{0.3}
\item The field for infinite static charge and current densities lying along the z-axis \( \rho(\Bx) = \lambda \delta(x) \delta(y), \BJ(\Bx) = \Bv \rho(\Bx) \) is found to be \( F = \lambda \rhocap \lr{ 1 - \Bv/c}/(2 \pi \epsilon R)\).
The field splits naturally into electric (vector) and magnetic (bivector) grades as \( F = \BE \lr{ 1 - \Bv/c } = \BE + I \lr{ \ifrac{\Bv}{c} \cross \BE } \).
\item As a problem, the reader was asked to compute the field for
the magnetic charge density \( \rho_m = \lambda_m \delta(x) \delta(y) \), and current density \( \BM = v \Be_3 \rho_m = \Bv \rho_m \).
That field is
\( F = \ifrac{\lambda_m c}{(4 \pi R)} I \rhocap \lr{ 1 - \ifrac{\Bv}{c} } \), which may be split into electric and magnetic components as
\( F = \BB \cross \Bv + c I \BB \), where \( \BB = \lambda_m \rhocap/(4 \pi R) \).
\item The field for a uniform infinite planar charge density \( \rho(\Bx) = \sigma \delta(z) \) and associated current density \( \BJ(\Bx) = \Bv \rho(\Bx) \), where \( \Bv = v \Be_1 e^{i\theta}, \quad i = \Be_{12} \) is found to be
\( F = \ifrac{\sigma \sgn(z)}{(4 \pi \epsilon)} \Be_3 \lr{ 1 - \ifrac{\Bv}{c}} \).
As should be expected by superposition, the field splits neatly into electric field (vector) and magnetic field (bivector) components associated with the respective pure electrostatic and magnetostatics problems.
\item As a problem the reader is asked to show that the field for an infinite planar
magnetic charge density \( \rho_m = \sigma_m \delta(z) \), and current density \( \BM = \Bv \rho_m, \Bv = v \Be_1 e^{i\theta}, i = \Be_{12}\) is \( F = \ifrac{\sigma_m c \sgn(z)}{(4 \pi)} i \lr{ 1 - \ifrac{\Bv}{c} } \).
\item The field for a line charge density \( \lambda \) along a circular arc segment \( \phi' \in [a,b] \), of radius \( r \) in the x-y plane is found to be \( F = \ifrac{\lambda r}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^2)} \int_{a-\phi}^{b-\phi} d\alpha \lr{ \rcap + \phicap u i e^{i \alpha } } \lr{ 1 + u^2 - 2 u \sin\theta \cos \alpha }^{-3/2} \), where \( i = \Be_{12} \).
This problem is often given as an example or problem in electrostatics, but usually for circular charge distribution, and an observation point on the z-axis where symmetries kill off all but the z-axis component of the field.
The freedom to represent rotational terms as complex exponentials in geometric algebra allows the more general problem to be calculated without much additional difficulty.
The resulting integrals can be evaluated easily with any existing numerical integration software as the vector factors \( \rcap, \phicap \) may be pulled out of the integrals, leaving strict scalar or complex valued integrands.
%\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/lineChargeArcFig1}{Circular line charge.}{fig:circularlinecharge:circularlinechargeFig1}{0.5}
\item To illustrate the algebraic flexibility available, the circular ring charge problem is tackled in cylindrical coordinates instead of spherical (as previous).
For a static charge line density \( \lambda \) on a ring at \( z = 0 \), and an azimuthal current density \( \BJ = \Bv \rho \), we find a closed form solution for the field is found.
The symmetry of the ring configuration allows for a closed form solution (numerical integration not required) of the field, but comes with the cost of requiring
elliptic integrals, which are detailed in the book along with the derivation and plots of the resulting fields.
%\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/chargeAndCurrentOnRingFig1}{Field due to a circular distribution.}{fig:chargeAndCurrentOnRing:chargeAndCurrentOnRingFig1}{0.3}
%}
\item The final worked statics problem in the book is a use of Ampere's law, to compute the magnetic field for a
pair of z-axis oriented electric currents of magnitude \( I_1, I_2 \) flowing through the \( z = 0 \) points \( \Bp_1, \Bp_2 \) on the x-y plane.
The geometry and derivation is detailed in the book, but we use the multivector line integral form of Ampere's law \( \ointctrclockwise_{\partial A} d\Bx F = -I \int_A dA \Be_3 (-\eta \BJ) = I \eta I_\txte \), and superposition to compute the field
\( F = \sum_{k = 1,2} \ifrac{\eta I_k}{(2 \pi)} \ifrac{1}{(\Be_3 \wedge \lr{ \Br - \Bp_k})} \).
The bivector (magnetic) nature of a field with only electric current density sources is naturally represented by the wedge product \( \Be_3 \wedge \lr{ \Br - \Bp_k} \) which is a vector product of \( \Be_3 \) and the projection of \( \Br - \Bp_k \) onto the x-y plane.
%\cref{fig:amperesLawBetweenTwoCurrents:amperesLawBetweenTwoCurrentsFig1}.
%\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/amperesLawBetweenTwoCurrentsFig1}{Magnetic field between two current sources.}{fig:amperesLawBetweenTwoCurrents:amperesLawBetweenTwoCurrentsFig1}{0.3}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dynamics.}
Maxwell's equation (\cref{dfn:isotropicMaxwells:680}) is invertable, with solution.
\input{Theorem_jefimenkos_report.tex}
This is found fairly easily using the Green's function for the spacetime gradient \cref{thm:greensFunctionSpacetimeGradient:120}, and the details can be found in the book.
%(\citep{griffiths1999introduction})
Unlike the conventional approach, we are able to find the field directly without first having to determine the retarded time potentials, nor having to take their derivatives.

\subsection{Energy and momentum.}
In the energy and momentum section of the book, the geometric algebra formulation of the field energy density, Poynting vector, Maxwell stress tensor, and more generally, the energy momentum tensor are fully detailed.
\input{Definition_energy_momentum_poynting.tex}
%\makedefinition{(Conventional) energy momentum and Maxwell stress tensors.}{dfn:poyntingF:1180}{
%The rank-2 symmetric tensor \( \Theta^{\mu\nu} \), with components
%%\label{eqn:poyntingF:840}
%\begin{equation*}
%\begin{aligned}
%\Theta^{00} &= \frac{\epsilon}{2} \lr{ \BE^2 + \eta^2 \BH^2 } \\

%and Latin letters such as \( i, j \)
%for the ``spatial'' indexes
%\( \setlr{1,2,3} \).
%The names and notation for the tensors vary considerably\footnote{\( \Theta^{\mu\nu} \) in

%\( T_{ij} (=-\Theta^{ij}) \)
%(\citep{griffiths1999introduction}, \citep{jackson1975cew}.)
%}.
In geometric algebra the energy momentum tensor, and the Maxwell stress tensor may be represented as linear grade 0,1 multivector valued functions of a grade 0,1 multivector.
\input{Definition_energy_momentum_and_maxwell_stress.tex}

\input{Theorem_energy_momentum_tensor_expansion.tex}

\Cref{thm:poyntingF:1240} relates the geometric algebra definition of the energy momentum tensor to the quantities found in the conventional
electromagnetism literature.
In the book, the conventional indexed representation is detailed more completely for comparision purposes.

Associated with the energy momentum tensor are a number of conservation relationships, which are most compactly stated utilizing the adjoint of the energy momenutum tensor.
\input{Definition_adjoint.tex}
\input{Theorem_poynting_differential.tex}
or in an integral form
\input{Theorem_poynting_integral.tex}

As the field in the volume is carrying the (electromagnetic) momentum \( \Bp_{\textrm{em}} = \int_V dV \bcP \), we can identify the sum of the Maxwell stress tensor's normal component over the bounding integral as time rate of change of the mechanical and electromagnetic momentum
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ece2500report:2560}
\frac{d}{dt} \Bp_{\textrm{mech}} + \frac{d}{dt} \Bp_{\textrm{em}} = \int_{\partial V} dA \BT(\ncap).
\end{equation}
The rate of change of mechanical momentum density \( \ifrac{d\Bp_{\textrm{mech}}}{dt} \) is, in fact, the continuous equivalent of the Lorentz force, which is found to be a direct consequence of conservation relationships associated with Maxwell's equation.

There were many details left out above.
Please refer to the book for more information.

\subsubsection{Example energy momentum calculations.}
To illustrate the ideas above, the energy momentum tensor components for all of the static fields computed previously are determined.
For brievity, these are omitted from this report, but it should be noted that we see that geometric algebra allows for a particularly compact coordinate free representation of the energy momentum tensor components.
\subsubsection{Complex power.}
The geometric algebra forms of the \( T(1) \) (field energy density and Poynting vector) are found to be
\input{Theorem_complex_power.tex}

\subsection{Lorentz force.}
The Lorentz force equation can be stated in terms of the total electromagnetic field strength and chacurrent density
\input{Theorem_lorentz_force_power_report.tex}

\subsubsection{Constant magnetic field.}
As another example of geometric algebra in action, the Lorentz force equation for a constant external magnetic field bivector \( F = I c \BB \)
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:lorentzForce_constantMagnetic:60}
m \frac{d\Bv}{dt} = q F \cdot \frac{\Bv}{c},
\end{dmath}
is solved in a fashion unique to this algebra.
With
\( \Omega = -\ifrac{q F}{m c} \), the Lorentz force equation is reduced to \( \ifrac{d\Bv}{dt} = \Bv \cdot \Omega \), which may be solved
using a multivector integration factor.
The solution is shown to be
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:lorentzForce_constantMagnetic:200}
\Bv(t) = e^{-\Omega t/2} \Bv(0) e^{\Omega t/2}.
\end{dmath}
Any component of the initial velocity \( \Bv(0)_\perp \) perpendicular to the \( \Omega \) plane is untouched by this rotation operation, whereas components of the initial velocity \( \Bv(0)_\parallel \) that lie in the \( \Omega \) plane will trace out a circular path, so the velocity of the charged particle traces out a helical path.

%A multivector integration factor method for solving the Lorentz force equation in constant mixed external electric and magnetic fields can be found in \citep{hestenes1999nfc}.
More general examples are considered in the literature cited in the book.

\subsection{Polarization}
Following the usual convention, the geometric algebra treatment of polarization in the book
aligns the propagation direction along the z-axis.
The field is
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:polarization:20}
\begin{aligned}
F(\Bx, \omega) &= (1 + \Be_3) \BE e^{-j \beta z} \\
F(\Bx, t) &= \Real\lr{ F(\Bx, \omega) e^{j \omega t} },
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
where \( \BE \cdot \Be_3 = 0 \).
Here the imaginary \( j \) has no intrinsic geometrical interpretation, but we are able to dispense with it and use geometric imaginaries instead.
This is done by first assuming the electric field is given by \( \BE = \lr{ \alpha_1 + j \beta_1 } \Be_1 + \lr{ \alpha_2 + j \beta_2 } \Be_2 \), so that the
time domain representation of the field is given by
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:polarization_circular:160}
F(\Bx, t) = (1 + \Be_3) \lr{
\lr{ \alpha_1 \Be_1 + \alpha_2 \Be_2 } \cos\lr{ \omega t - \beta z }
-\lr{ \beta_1 \Be_1 + \beta_2 \Be_2 } \sin\lr{ \omega t - \beta z }
}.
\end{dmath}

Two geometric representations are possible.
The first uses the pseudoscalar for the transverse plane \( \Be_{12} \), denoted \( i \) here, and the other uses the \R{3} pseudoscalar as the imaginary.
\subsubsection{Transverse plane imaginary.}
\input{Theorem_circular_polarization_coeff_report.tex}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Linear polarization at an angle \( \psi\) from the x-axis in the transverse plane is given by
\( \alpha_\txtR = \inv{2}\Norm{\BE} e^{i(\psi + \theta)},
\alpha_\txtL = \inv{2}\Norm{\BE} e^{i(\psi - \theta)} \), for which the field is \( F = \lr{ 1 + \Be_3 } \Norm{\BE} \Be_1 e^{i \psi} \cos(\phi + \theta) \),
where \( \theta \) is an initial phase angle.
\item 
% discussed in \citep{balanis1989advanced}
Following the IEEE antenna convention, we define right(left) circular polarization as the
a change in phase that
results in the electric field tracing out a (clockwise,counterclockwise) circle
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:polarization_circular:180}
\begin{aligned}
\BE_\txtR &= \Norm{\BE} \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\phi + \Be_2 \sin\phi } = \Norm{\BE} \Be_1 \exp\lr{  \Be_{12} \phi } \\
\BE_\txtL &= \Norm{\BE} \lr{ \Be_1 \cos\phi - \Be_2 \sin\phi } = \Norm{\BE} \Be_1 \exp\lr{ -\Be_{12} \phi }.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
Right and left circular polarization in this representation are given by
\(\alpha_\txtR = \Norm{\BE}, \alpha_\txtL = 0 \) and \(\alpha_\txtL = \Norm{\BE}, \alpha_\txtR = 0 \) respectively.
The right(left) polarized fields are just
\( F = (1 + \Be_3) \Norm{\BE} \Be_1 e^{\pm i(\omega t - k z)} \).
\item An ellipically polzarized field is given by
\( \alpha_\txtR = \inv{2}\lr{ E_a - E_b },
\alpha_\txtL = \inv{2}\lr{ E_a + E_b } \), or
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:ece2500report:2580}
F = \inv{2} (1 + \Be_3) \Be_1 \lr{ (E_a + E_b) e^{i\phi} + (E_a - E_b) e^{-i\phi} }
\end{dmath}
A hyperbolic hyperbolic parameterization of the elliptically polarized wave is also discussed in the book.
In particular,
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:polarization_elliptical:380}
\begin{aligned}
F &= e E_a \lr{ 1 + \Be_3 } \Be_1 e^{ i \psi } \cosh\lr{ m + i \phi} \\
m &= \tanh^{-1}\lr{ E_b/E_a } \\
e &= \sqrt{1 - {(E_b/E_a)}^2 },
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
where \( E_a(E_b) \) are the magnitudes of the electric field components lying along the semi-major axis directed along \(
\begin{bmatrix}
\Be_1 \\
\Be_2
\end{bmatrix}
e^{i\psi} \) respectively.
Additional discussion and diagrams can be found in the book.
%\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/ellipticalPolarizationFig1}{Electric field with elliptical polarization.}{fig:ellipticalPolarization:ellipticalPolarizationFig1}{0.3}
\end{itemize}

Each polarization considered above (linear, circular, elliptical) have the same general form
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:polarizationRewrite:760}
F = \lr{ 1 + \Be_3 } \Be_1 e^{i\psi} f(\phi),
\end{dmath}
where \( f(\phi) \) is a complex valued function (i.e. grade 0,2).
The structure of \cref{eqn:polarizationRewrite:760} could be more general than considered so far.
For example, a Gaussian modulation could be added into the mix with \( f(\phi) = e^{i \phi - (\phi/\sigma)^2/2 } \).
The simple complex structure that encodes all the phase dependence allows the
energy, momentum and Maxwell stress tensor to be computed easily.
\input{Theorem_energy_momentum_tensor_plane_wave.tex}

Only the propagation direction of a plane wave, regardless of its polarization (or even whether or not there are Gaussian or other damping factors), carries any energy or momentum, and only the propagation direction component of the Maxwell stress tensor \( \BT(\Ba) \) is non-zero.

Using \cref{thm:polarizationRewrite:780} the energy momentum vector may be computed for each of the polarizations considered above.
\begin{itemize}
\item
For the linearly polarization \( T(1) = \ifrac{\epsilon}{2} \lr{ 1 + \Be_3 } \Norm{\BE}^2 \cos^2( \phi + \theta ) \).
\item For the circularly polarization \( T(1) = \ifrac{\epsilon}{2} (1 + \Be_3) \Norm{\BE}^2 \).
A circularly polarized wave carries maximum energy and momentum, whereas the energy and momentum of a linearly polarized wave
oscillates with the phase angle.
\item For the elliptical polarization \(
T(1)
= \frac{\epsilon}{2} \lr{ 1 + \Be_3 } e^2 E_a^2 \lr{ \frac{E_b^2}{E_a^2} + 2 \lr{ 1 - \frac{E_b^2}{E_a^2} } \cos^2 \phi } \).
As expected, the phase dependent portion of the energy momentum tensor vanishes as the wave function approaches circular polarization.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pseudoscalar imaginary.}
Alternatively, it is possible to encode the sines and cosines in the time domain representation of the field in terms of the \R{3} pseudoscalar.

\input{Theorem_circular_polarization_coeff_pseudoscalar_report.tex}

There appear to be some advantages to pseudoscalar description of polarization, especially for computing energy momentum tensor components since \( I \) commutes with all grades.
For example, we can see practically by inspection that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:polarization_pseudoscalarImaginary:620}
T(1) = \calE + \frac{\BS}{v} =
\epsilon \lr{ 1 + \Be_3 } \lr{ \Abs{\alpha_\txtR}^2 + \Abs{\alpha_\txtL}^2 },
\end{equation}
where the absolute value is computed using the reverse as the conjugation operation \( \Abs{z}^2 = z z^\dagger \).

\subsection{Transverse fields in a waveguide.}
One topic from waveguide theory is considered in the book.
\input{Theorem_transverse_and_propagation_solutions_report.tex}

Details and proof are in the book.
This and many other examples in the book show that we pay a significant additional cost to work with separate electric and magnetic field components compared to working with the complete electromagnetic field multivector \( F \) in its entirety.

\subsection{Multivector potential.}
Conventional electromagnetism utilizes scalar and vector potentials, which may be generalized to a multivector potential containing their sums.
\input{multivector_potential}

The grades of the multivector potentials may be chosen to match SI conventions (as specified in Balanis' ``Antenna Theory'',
which includes fictitious magnetic sources),
% and those of \citep{balanis2005antenna} (
%) are used in the book as follows.
\input{Theorem_fields_and_potential_wave_equations_report.tex}

Also detailed in the book is the multivector formulation of gauge transformation that allows the grade selection operation in
\cref{thm:generalPotential:80} to be removed.

\input{Theorem_gauge_invariance.tex}

We say that we are working in the Lorenz gauge, if the 0,3 grades of \( \conjstgradi A \) are zero, or a transformation that kills those grades is made.
\input{Theorem_lorentz_gauge_transformation.tex}

Please see the book for proofs and additional details, including the explcit integral solution of \( \Psi \) required for the transformation to the Lorentz gauge.

\subsection{Far field.}
The geometric algebra form for the far field associated with a vector (or dual-vector) potential has a fairly simple coordinate free form.
\input{Theorem_far_field_magnetic_vector_potential_report.tex}
Noting that \( \rcap (\rcap \wedge \BA) \) is the rejection of the radial component of \( \BA \) (i.e. is a vector not a multivector) allows the far-field solution to easily be split into electric and magnetic field components if desired.
These are detailed in the book, along with the proof of \cref{thm:potentialSection_farfield:1}.
Also included in the book is an example calculation of \( F = -j \omega \lr{ 1 + \rcap } \lr{ \rcap \wedge \BA} \) for the dipole vector potential.

\subsection{Dielectric and magnetic media.}
The majority of the electromagnetic theory covered in the book focused on fields with the
isotropic constitutive relationships \cref{eqn:freespace:300}.
For more general consitutive relationships the geometric algebra form of Maxwell's equations requires a pair of
multivector equations, fields and sources as follows.
\input{Theorem_maxwells_equations_in_media.tex}

Along with some discussion of solution of these more complicated equations, gauge-like transformations of the fields are discussed.
More work is required to fully flesh out this topic, especially given that \( F, G \) may be directly coupled, allowing neither field to be solved for independently.

\subsection{Boundary value conditions.}
Independent of the techniques used to find the multivector fields \( F, G \) for electromagnetism in matter, we may use \cref{thm:dielectric:20} to easily derive the boundary
value conditions for the fields spanning a surface with surface currents or charges, or even just a discontinuity in the media.
\input{Theorem_boundary_value_relations.tex}

A simple proof is possible by integrating the pair of Maxwell's equations over the pillbox configuration, allowing the height \( n \) of that pillbox above or below the surface to tend to zero,
and the area of the pillbox top to also tend to zero, using \cref{thm:volumeintegral:100} to transform the multivector integrals to boundary integrals.
Figures and the full proof are available in the book.

Note that in the special case where there are surface charge and current densities along the interface surface, but the media is uniform (\(\epsilon_1 = \epsilon_2, \mu_1 = \mu_2\)), then the field and current relationship has a particularily simple form% \citep{chappell2014geometric}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:boundarySurfaceSources:421}
\ncap (F_2 - F_1) = J_s.
\end{dmath}

\section{Conclusions.}

Encountering Maxwell's equation in its geometric algebra form \cref{eqn:quaternion2maxwellWithGA:20} leaves the student with more questions than answers.
It is a compact representation, but so are the tensor and differential forms representations of Maxwell's equations.
The student needs to know how to work with the representation if it is to be useful.
Study of application of conventional electromagnetism can exploit a large set of well developed tools, and it is not obvious how many of these apply to the GA form of Maxwell's equations.
Individually, there are answers available to many of the questions that are generated attempting to apply the theory, but they are scattered and in many cases not easily accessible.

The product of this project was an attempt to collect all the prerequisite concepts for the application of geometric algebra to electromagnetism, and provide a conceptual map that shows how to obtain familiar conventional results from the equivalent geometric algebra formalism.
Chapter III of the book illustrates many cases where electromagnetism is considerably simpler when computations are performed with an electromagnetic field \( F = \BE + I \eta \BH \) uniformly incorporating both the electric and magnetic fields.
Compared to the tensor formalism of high energy physics and field theory, where \( F_{\mu\nu} \) also merges the electric and magnetic fields into a single entity, it is trivial to extract the constituent fields from the geometric algebra representation, and many examples of how to do so are supplied in the book.
This provides the student with a powerful theoretical framework, without sacrificing the ability to use any familiar conventional tools when desired.
In many cases, geometric algebra provides compact and interesting ways to obtain the familiar identities and relationships, and also connects ideas that are not neccesarily obviously related in the conventional formalism.

In many ways this work only scratches the surface.
Many more worked examples, problems, figures and computer algebra listings should be added.
In depth applications of derived geometric algebra relationships to problems customarily tackled with separate electric and magnetic field equations should also be incorporated.
There are also theoretical holes, topics covered in any conventional introductory electromagnetism text, that are missing.
Examples include the Fresnel relationships for transmission and reflection at an interface, in depth treatment of waveguides, dipole radiation and motion of charged particles, bound charges, and meta materials to name a few.
Many of these topics can probably be handled in a coordinate free fashion using geometric algebra.
Despite all the work that is required to help bridge the gap between formalism and application, making applied electromagnetism using geometric algebra truly accessible, it is the belief of the author that this project has made some a good first steps down this path.
