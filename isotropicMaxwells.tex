Assuming
isotropic constituency relationships \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:300}, and
eliminating cross products in favor of wedge products,
Maxwell's equations \cref{eqn:freespace:99} become

\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:61}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:60}
\spacegrad \wedge \BE = - I \BM - \mu \PD{t}{(I\BH)}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:80}
\spacegrad \wedge \BH = I \BJ + I \epsilon \PD{t}{\BE}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:100}
\spacegrad \cdot \BE = \rho/\epsilon
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:120}
\spacegrad \cdot \BH = \rho_\txtm/\mu.
\end{dmath}
\end{subequations}

With a bit of rescaling, the dot and wedge products of \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:60}, \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:100} can be added, as can those of \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:80}, \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:120}.  This reduces Maxwell's equations to a pair of first order coupled gradient equations

\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:361}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:360}
\spacegrad \BE = \inv{\epsilon} \rho - I \BM - \mu \PD{t}{(I\BH)}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:380}
\spacegrad (I \BH) = \frac{I \rho_\txtm}{\mu} - \BJ - \epsilon \PD{t}{\BE}.
\end{dmath}
\end{subequations}

There is a symmetry in \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:361} that an be made more apparent by
making a transformation to fields with the same dimensions \( \sqrt{\epsilon} \BE, \sqrt{\mu} \BH \)

\begin{subequations}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:400}
\spacegrad (\sqrt{\epsilon} \BE) = \inv{\sqrt{\epsilon}} \rho - I \sqrt{\epsilon} \BM - \sqrt{\epsilon \mu} \PD{t}{(I\sqrt{\mu} \BH)}
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:420}
\spacegrad (I \sqrt{\mu} \BH) = \frac{I \rho_\txtm}{\sqrt{\mu}} - \sqrt{\mu} \BJ - \sqrt{\epsilon\mu} \PD{t}{\sqrt{\epsilon} \BE}.
\end{dmath}
\end{subequations}

Observations
\begin{itemize}
\item
The electric charge density of \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:400} has a corresponding dual magnetic charge density in \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:420}.
\item
There is a similar dual relationship between the electric and magnetic current densities and the fields themselves.
\item
The multivector equation \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:400} has grades 0,2 (scalar and bivector), whereas the multivector equation \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:420} has grades 1,3 (vector, pseudoscalar).
\item
The
dimensions of the space and time differential operators \( [\spacegrad] = [\sqrt{\epsilon\mu} \PDi{t}{}] = 1/L = [\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}\PDi{t}{}]\) are equal.
now equal,
\end{itemize}

Without any overlap of grades, it is possible to add (or subtract) these equations without any loss of information, as
the original equations could always be recovered by grade selection.
Adding \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:400} gives

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:maxwellsEquations:440}
\lr{ \spacegrad + \sqrt{\epsilon\mu} \PD{t}{} }
\lr{ \sqrt{\epsilon} \BE
+
I \sqrt{\mu} \BH
}
=
\inv{\sqrt{\epsilon}} \rho
- I \sqrt{\epsilon} \BM
+\lr{
\frac{I \rho_\txtm}{\sqrt{\mu}}
- \sqrt{\mu} \BJ
}
.
\end{dmath}

With the engineering convention, using \( \BE \) and \( \BH \) as the primary fields, we have constructed the GA Maxwell equation

\boxedEquation{eqn:maxwellsEquations:460}{
\begin{aligned}
F &= \BE + \eta I \BH \\
J &=
\eta
\lr{ v \rho - \BJ }
+ I \lr{ v \rho_\txtm - \BM } \\
\lr{ \spacegrad + \inv{v} \PD{t}{} } F
&= J.
\end{aligned}
}

Here

\begin{itemize}
\item \( F = \BE + \eta I \BH \) [\si{V/m}] (Volts/meter), is the electromagnetic field intensity.  This is a multivector field with vector and bivector components.
\item \( J = \lr{ v \rho - \BJ } + I \lr{ v \rho_\txtm - \BM } \) ([\si{A/m^2}] (Amperes/square meter)),
is a multivector source containing all the electric and magnetic charge and current densities.  This source multivector has one grade for each possible source (scalar, vector, bivector, trivector).
\item \( \eta = \sqrt{\mu/\epsilon} \) (\( [\Omega] \) Ohms), is the impedance of the media, and
\item \( v = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu} \) ([\si{m/s}] meters/second), is the group velocity of a wave in the media.
\end{itemize}

Maxwell's equation \cref{eqn:maxwellsEquations:460} is a
single multivector equation that relates a combined electromagnetic field to all the sources, including fictional magnetic sources if desired.
%With electric and magnetic fields being observer frame dependent, we

There will be a number of problems where it will be simpler to solve for the electromagnetic field than to solve separately for the electric and magnetic fields.  Given such a field solution, the electric and magnetic fields can be recovered by grade selection

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:isotropicMaxwells:480}
\begin{aligned}
\BE &= \gpgradeone{F} \\
I \BH &= \inv{\eta} \gpgradetwo{F}.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
