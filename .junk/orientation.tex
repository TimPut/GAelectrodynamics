\subsection{Orientation.  figure out where to put this}
Geometric algebra provides a mathematical representation for geometrical objects of each dimension in the space.
In a three dimensional space, there are representations for all of

\begin{itemize}
\item
oriented (signed) points with magnitude
\item
oriented line segments,
\item
oriented planes,
\item
oriented volumes,
\end{itemize}

and in higher dimensional spaces, it will be possible to represent higher dimensonal oriented hypervolumes.
