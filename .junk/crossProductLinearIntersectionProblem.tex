\makeanswer{problem:crossProductLinearIntersectionProblem:1}{

Because vector division in \R{3} is not traditionally available, the solution would have to take the form

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:crossProductLinearIntersectionProblem:10}
\begin{aligned}
s &= -\frac{(\Bd \cross \Bu_2) \cdot (\Bu_1 \cross \Bu_2)}{\Norm{\Bu_1 \cross \Bu_2}^2} \\
t &= -\frac{(\Bd \cross \Bu_1) \cdot (\Bu_1 \cross \Bu_2)}{\Norm{\Bu_1 \cross \Bu_2}^2},
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

where the restriction required for solution validity would be \( ( \Bd \cross \Bu_2 ) \cross (\Bu_1 \cross \Bu_2 ) = 0 \).
