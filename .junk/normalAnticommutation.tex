\makeanswer{problem:multiplication:unitsquare}{
Consider the square of a vector \( \Bx = u \Bu + v \Bv \) with respect to a basis of unit vectors \( \setlr{ \Bu, \Bv }\).  That is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:introGAproblems:160}
\Bx^2
=
\lr{ u \Bu + v \Bv }
\lr{ u \Bu + v \Bv }
=
u^2 \Bu^2
+ v^2 \Bv^2
+ u v \lr{ \Bu \Bv + \Bv \Bu }
=
u^2
+ v^2
+ u v \lr{ \Bu \Bv + \Bv \Bu }.
\end{dmath}

If these vectors are normal \( \Bx^2 = u^2 + v^2 \), which means
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:introGAproblems:180}
\Bu \Bv = -\Bv \Bu.
\end{dmath}

Observe that a side effect of this computation shows that the traditional vector dot product of two unit vectors can also be written as a symmetric bivector sum

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:introGAproblems:200}
\Bu \cdot \Bv = \inv{2} \lr{ \Bu \Bv + \Bv \Bu }.
\end{dmath}
