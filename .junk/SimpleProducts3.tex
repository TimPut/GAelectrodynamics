\section{MESS}
The wedge product is related to the cross product, but can generalizes the cross product to two dimensions where there is no normal direction, and can generalize the cross product to greater than three dimensions, where any plane has too many normal directions.
The cross product is a (pseudo)vector that has a magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by the crossed vectors, but is pointed normal to the plane of those vectors.
It will be possible to interpret the wedge product as the oriented (signed) area of that parallelogram itself without reference to any normal direction.
In the same sense that a vector is a representation of an oriented line segment, we will see that the wedge product of two vectors can be thought of as a representation of a oriented plane segment.

Recall (\cref{problem:SimpleProducts2:areaofparallelogram}) that the absolute value of this determinant is precisely the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors \( \Ba \) and \( \Bb \).  The wedge product, a bivector, can therefore be interpretted as an oriented (signed) area.  This is illustrated in \cref{fig:orientedParallelogram:orientedParallelogramFig1}.

Observe that in \R{2} the product of any basis vector with a pseudoscalar is normal to the original vector, which is also generally true for any vector in a 2D space,

Such a multiplication induces a \( \pi/2 \) rotation, the direction of which depends on the orientation of pseudoscalar, and upon whether the multiplication is performed from the left or the right.

This unit bivector is seen to square to minus one like the imaginary in complex algebra.
The reader can confirm easily that this is generally true for any unit bivector \( \Be_i \Be_j, \, i \ne j \).
This is a very convienient fact, and allows ad-hoc construction of complex number like coordinate systems in any given planar subspace.

It was previously claimed that the pseudoscalar \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \) could be interpretted as an oriented (signed) area.
Because \( \Be_1 \cdot \Be_2 = 0 \), this vector product is also equal to the wedge

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:640}
\Be_1 \Be_2 = \Be_1 \cdot \Be_2 +
\Be_1 \wedge \Be_2
=
\Be_1 \wedge \Be_2.
\end{dmath}

Recall that the area of the parallopiped spanned by two vectors in a two dimensional space is given by the absolute value of

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:SimpleProducts2:660}
\begin{vmatrix}
   x_1 & x_2 \\
   y_1 & y_2
\end{vmatrix},
\end{dmath}

a factor that was also found in the coordinate expansion of the wedge product (\cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:560}).
It is therefore natural to interpret the wedge product as an oriented area.
(cut)
In higher dimensonal spaces, the bivector factor not only encodes a sign for this area, but also its orientation in space.
The wedge product will be seen to encode that orientation without introducing a normal direction for the spanning plane, a nice feature in higher dimensional spaces where a single normal direction is ambiguous.

Because there are many possible pairs of generating vectors for any given bivector, any oriented area in a given plane with a specified area are all equally valid interpretations of a bivector.
