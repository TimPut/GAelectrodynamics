\makeproblem{\R{3}}{problem:prerequisites:R3}{
Define \R{3} as the set of triples \( \setlr{ (x_1, x_2, x_3) | x_i \in \bbR } \).  Given
\( \Bx = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \in \bbR^3 \),
\( \By = (y_1, y_2, y_3) \in \bbR^3 \), and \( a \in \bbR \), then addition and multiplication operations can be defined respectively as

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\Bx + \By &\equiv (x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, x_3 + y_3) \\
a \Bx &\equiv (a x_1 , a x_2 , a x_3 ).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Show that \R{3} is a vector space.
