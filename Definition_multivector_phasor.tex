\makedefinition{Multivector phasor representation.}{dfn:greensFunctionOverview:300}{
The \textit{phasor representation} \( F(\Bx) \) of a multivector valued (real) function \( F(\Bx, t) \) is defined implicitly as
\begin{equation*}
F(\Bx, t) = \Real\lr{ F(\Bx) e^{j \omega t} },
\end{equation*}
where \( j \) is an arbitrary scalar imaginary that commutes with all multivectors.
