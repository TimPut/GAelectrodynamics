\makedefinition{Plane wave.}{dfn:planewavesMultivector:680}{
We represent the
electromagnetic field strength
plane wave solution of Maxwell's equation in phasor form as
\begin{equation*}
F(\Bx, t) = \Real \lr{ F(\Bk) e^{ j \omega t }  },
\end{equation*}
where the complex valued multivector \( F(\Bk) \) also has a presumed exponential dependence
\begin{equation*}
F(\Bk)
=
\tilde{F}
e^{ -j \Bk \cdot \Bx }.
\end{equation*}
