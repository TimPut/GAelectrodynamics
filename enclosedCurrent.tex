In conventional electrostatics we obtain a relation between the normal electric field component and the enclosed charge.
The geometric algebra generalization of this is a relation between the field and the enclosed multivector current
\maketheorem{Enclosed multivector current.}{thm:enclosedCurrent:60}{
The total multivector current in the volume is related to the surface integral of \( \ncap F \) over the boundary of the volume by
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\partial V} dA \ncap F = \int_V dV J.
\end{equation*}
This is a multivector equation, carrying inforamation for each grade in the multivector current, and after explicit expansion is equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cdot \BE        &=  \inv{\epsilon} \int_V dV\, \rho \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cross \BH       &=                 \int_V dV\, \BJ \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cross \BE       &=               - \int_V dV\, \BM \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cdot \BH        &=  \inv{\mu} \int_V dV\, \rho_\txtm.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
} % theorem

To prove \cref{thm:enclosedCurrent:60}
simply evaluate the volume integral of the gradient of the field using \cref{thm:volumeintegral:100}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:enclosedCurrent:20}
\int_V dV \spacegrad F = \int_{\partial V} dA \ncap F,
\end{equation}
and note that
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:enclosedCurrent:60}
\int_V dV \spacegrad F = \int_V dV J.
\end{dmath}
This is a multivector relationship, containing a substantial amount of information, which can be
extracted by
expanding \( \ncap F \)
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:enclosedCurrent:40}
\ncap F
=
\ncap \lr{ \BE + I \eta \BH }
=
\ncap \cdot \BE + I (\ncap \cross \BE) + I \eta \lr{ \ncap \cdot \BH + I \ncap \cross \BH }
=
\ncap \cdot \BE - \eta ( \ncap \cross \BH ) + I (\ncap \cross \BE) + I \eta (\ncap \cdot \BH).
\end{dmath}
Inserting this into
\cref{thm:enclosedCurrent:60}, and equating grades, we find
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:enclosedCurrent:80}
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\partial V} dA \ncap \cdot \BE &= \int_V dV \inv{\epsilon}\rho \\
- \int_{\partial V} dA \eta ( \ncap \cross \BH ) &= - \int_V dV \eta \BJ \\
 I \int_{\partial V} dA (\ncap \cross \BE) &= - I \int_V dV \BM \\
 I \int_{\partial V} dA \eta (\ncap \cdot \BH) &=  I \int_V dV c \rho_\txtm,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

which completes the proof after cancelling common factors and some minor adjustments of the multiplicative constants.
Of course \cref{eqn:enclosedCurrent:80}
could have obtained directly from Maxwell's equations in their conventional form \cref{eqn:freespace:3399}.
However, had we integrated the conventional Maxwell's equations, it would not have been obvious that the crazy mix of
fields, sources, dot and cross products in \cref{eqn:enclosedCurrent:60} had a hidden structure as simple as
\( \int_{\partial V} dA \ncap F = \int_V dV J \).
