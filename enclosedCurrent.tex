We have already solved the statics equation using Green's function techniques, but we can also gain additional insight by simply integrating Maxwell's equation using \cref{thm:volumeintegral:100} which gives
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:enclosedCurrent:20}
\int_V dV \spacegrad F = \int_{\partial V} dA \ncap F = \int_V dV J
\end{equation}
The total current in the volume is related to the surface integral of \( \ncap F \) over the boundary of the volume.
This is a multivector relationship, containing a substantial amount of information.
This information can be extracted by
expanding \( \ncap F \)
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:enclosedCurrent:40}
\ncap F
=
\ncap \lr{ \BE + I \eta \BH }
=
\ncap \cdot \BE + I (\ncap \cross \BE) + I \eta \lr{ \ncap \cdot \BH + I \ncap \cross \BH }
=
\ncap \cdot \BE - \eta ( \ncap \cross \BH ) + I (\ncap \cross \BE) + I \eta (\ncap \cdot \BH),
\end{dmath}
so
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:enclosedCurrent:60}
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cdot \BE        &=  \inv{\epsilon} \int_V dV\, \rho \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cross \BH       &=                 \int_V dV\, \BJ \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cross \BE       &=               - \int_V dV\, \BM \\
\int_{\partial V} dA\, \ncap \cdot \BH        &=  \inv{\mu} \int_V dV\, \rho_\txtm.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
Of course \cref{eqn:enclosedCurrent:60}
could have obtained directly from Maxwell's equations in their conventional form \cref{eqn:freespace:3399}.
However, had we integrated the conventional Maxwell's equations, it would not have been obvious that the crazy mix of
fields, dot and cross products in \cref{eqn:enclosedCurrent:60} had a hidden structure as simple as
\( \int_{\partial V} dA \ncap F = \int_V dV J \).
