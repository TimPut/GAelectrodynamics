\makeproblem{Normal multiplication with complex exponential.}{problem:normalMult:1}{
Show that any component of a vector normal to the x-y plane commutes with the complex exponential rotation operator for that plane.
} % problem

\makeanswer{problem:normalMult:1}{
This can be demonstrated by considering any vector \( \Be_k \), \( k \ne 1,2 \), such as \( \Be_3 \)

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:normalMult:20}
\Be_3 e^{i\theta}
=
\Be_3 \lr{ \cos\theta + \Be_1 \Be_2 \sin\theta }
=
\Be_3 \cos\theta + \Be_3 \Be_1 \Be_2 \sin\theta
=
\Be_3 \cos\theta - \Be_1 \Be_3 \Be_2 \sin\theta
=
\Be_3 \cos\theta + \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \sin\theta
=
\lr{ \cos\theta + \Be_1 \Be_2 \sin\theta  } \Be_3
=
e^{i\theta} \Be_3.
\end{dmath}
