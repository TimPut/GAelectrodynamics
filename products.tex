\index{vector product}
The product of two colinear vectors is a scalar, and the product of two normal vectors is a bivector.
The product of two general vectors is a multivector with structure to be determined.
A powerful way to examine this structure is to compute the product of two vectors in a polar representation with respect to the plane that they span.
Let \( \ucap \) and \( \vcap \) be an orthonormal pair of vectors in the plane of \( \Ba \) and \( \Bb \), oriented in a positive rotational sense as illustrated in
\cref{fig:Parallelogram:ParallelogramFig1}.
\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/ParallelogramFig1}{Two vectors in a plane.}{fig:Parallelogram:ParallelogramFig1}{0.3}

With respect to the orthonormal vectors \( \ucap \) and \( \vcap \), a
a polar representation of \( \Ba, \Bb \) is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1660}
\begin{aligned}
\Ba &= \Norm{\Ba} \ucap e^{ i_{ab} \theta_a } = \Norm{\Ba} e^{ -i_{ab} \theta_a } \ucap \\
\Bb &= \Norm{\Bb} \ucap e^{ i_{ab} \theta_b } = \Norm{\Bb} e^{ -i_{ab} \theta_b } \ucap,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
where \( i_{ab} = \ucap \vcap \) is a unit pseudoscalar for the planar subspace spanned by \( \Ba \) and \( \Bb \).
The vector product of these two vectors is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1680}
\Ba \Bb
=
\lr{ \Norm{\Ba} e^{ -i_{ab} \theta_a } \ucap } \lr{ \Norm{\Bb} \ucap e^{ i_{ab} \theta_b } }
=
 \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb}
e^{ -i_{ab} \theta_a } ( \ucap \ucap ) e^{ i_{ab} \theta_b }
=
 \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb}
e^{ i_{ab} (\theta_b - \theta_a)}.
=
 \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb}
\lr{
\cos
(\theta_b - \theta_a)
+ i_{ab}
\sin
(\theta_b - \theta_a)
}.
\end{dmath}

We see that the product of two vectors is a multivector that has only grades 0 and 2.
This can be expressed symbolically as

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1800}
\Ba \Bb
=
\gpgradezero{ \Ba \Bb }
+
\gpgradetwo{ \Ba \Bb }.
\end{dmath}

We recognize the scalar grade of the vector product as the \R{N} dot product, but the grade 2 component of the vector product is something new that requires a name.
We respectively identify and define operators for these vector grade selection operations

\index{wedge product}
\index{dot product}
\makedefinition{Dot and wedge products of two vectors.}{dfn:products:dotandwedge}{
Given two vectors \( \Ba, \Bb \in \bbR^{N} \) the dot product is identified as the scalar grade of their product
\begin{equation*}
\gpgradezero{ \Ba \Bb }
=
\Ba \cdot \Bb
.
\end{equation*}

A wedge product of the vectors is defined as a grade-2 selection operation
\begin{equation*}
\Ba \wedge \Bb \equiv \gpgradetwo{ \Ba \Bb }.
\end{equation*}

Given this notation, the product of two vectors can be written
\begin{equation*}
\Ba \Bb = \Ba \cdot \Bb + \Ba \wedge \Bb.
\end{equation*}
} % definition

\index{grade selection}
Scalar grade selection of a product of two vectors is an important new tool.
There will be many circumstances where the easiest way to compute a dot product is using scalar grade selection.

The split of a vector product into dot and wedge product components is also important.
However, to utilize it, the properties of the wedge product have to be determined.

Summarizing \cref{eqn:products:1680} with our new operators, we write
\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1700}{
\begin{aligned}
\Ba \Bb &= \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \exp\lr{ i_{ab} (\theta_b - \theta_a) } \\
\Ba \cdot \Bb &= \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \cos( \theta_b - \theta_a ) \\
\Ba \wedge \Bb &= i_{ab} \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \sin( \theta_b - \theta_a ),
\end{aligned}
}

\makeexample{Products of two unit vectors.}{example:products:1860}{
To develop some intuition about the vector product, let's consider product of two unit vectors \( \Ba, \Bb \) in the equilateral triangle of
\cref{fig:exponentialVectorProduct:exponentialVectorProductFig1}, where

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1880}
\begin{aligned}
\Ba &= \inv{\sqrt{2}} \lr{ \Be_3 + \Be_1 } = \Be_3 \exp\lr{ \Be_{31} \pi/4 } \\
\Bb &= \inv{\sqrt{2}} \lr{ \Be_3 + \Be_2 } = \Be_3 \exp\lr{ \Be_{32} \pi/4 }.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

\imageFigure{../figures/GAelectrodynamics/exponentialVectorProductFig1}{Equilateral triangle in \R{3}.}{fig:exponentialVectorProduct:exponentialVectorProductFig1}{0.3}

The product of these vectors is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1900}
\Ba \Bb
=
\inv{2} \lr{ \Be_3 + \Be_1 } \lr{ \Be_3 + \Be_2 }
=
\inv{2} \lr{ 1 + \Be_{32} + \Be_{13} + \Be_{12 } }
=
\inv{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{\Be_{32} + \Be_{13} + \Be_{12 } }{\sqrt{3}}.
\end{dmath}

Let the bivector factor be designated

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1920}
j = \frac{\Be_{32} + \Be_{13} + \Be_{12 } }{\sqrt{3}}.
\end{dmath}

The reader can check (\cref{problem:products:2000})
that \( j \) is a unit bivector (i.e. it squares to \( -1 \)), allowing us to write

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1940}
\Ba \Bb =
\inv{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} j
= \cos(\pi/3) + j \sin(\pi/3)
= \exp\lr{ j \pi/3 }.
\end{dmath}

Since both vector factors were unit length, this ``complex'' exponential has no leading scalar factor contribution from \( \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \).

From the above analysis, we can also see that in this case, the product of two 0,2 multivectors was itself a 0,2 multivector.  We can see that by forming the product

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1960}
\Ba \Bb =
\biglr{
   \exp\lr{ -\Be_{31} \pi/4 } \Be_3 }
\biglr{
   \Be_3 \exp\lr{ \Be_{32} \pi/4 }
}
=
\exp\lr{ -\Be_{31} \pi/4 }
\exp\lr{ \Be_{32} \pi/4 },
\end{dmath}
so
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1980}
\exp\lr{ \Be_{13} \pi/4 }
\exp\lr{ \Be_{32} \pi/4 } = \exp\lr{ j \pi/3 }.
\end{dmath}

Composition of two rotation operators has resulted in another rotation operator, but that result is in a different rotational plane, and through a different rotation angle.
} % example

\index{polar representation}
Two wedge product properties can be immediately deduced from the polar representation of \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1700}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \( \Bb \wedge \Ba = - \Ba \wedge \Bb \).
\item \( \Ba \wedge (\alpha \Ba) = 0, \quad \forall \alpha \in \bbR \).
\end{enumerate}

We have now had a few hints that the wedge product might be related to the cross product.  Given two vectors \( \Ba, \Bb \) both the wedge and the cross product contain a \( \Norm{\Ba} \Norm{\Bb} \sin \Delta \theta \) factor, and both the wedge and cross product are antisymmetric operators.
The cross product is a bilinear operator \( (\Ba + \Bb) \cross (\Bc + \Bd) = \Ba \cross \Bc + \Ba \cross \Bc + \cdots \).  To see whether this is the case for the wedge product, let's examine the coordinate expansion of the wedge product.  Let

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1160}
\begin{aligned}
\Ba &= \sum_i a_i \Be_i \\
\Bb &= \sum_i b_i \Be_i.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

The product of these vectors is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1360}
\Ba \Bb
=
\lr{ \sum_i a_i \Be_i } \lr{ \sum_j b_j \Be_j }
=
\sum_{ij} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
=
\sum_{i = j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
+
\sum_{i \ne j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j.
\end{dmath}

Since \( \Be_i \Be_i = 1 \), we see again that the scalar component of the product is the dot product \( \sum_i a_i b_i \).
The remaining grade 2 components are the wedge product, for which the coordinate expansion can be simplified further

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1460}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\sum_{i \ne j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
=
\sum_{i < j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
+
\sum_{j < i} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
=
\sum_{i < j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
+
\sum_{i < j} a_j b_i \Be_j \Be_i
%=
%\sum_{i < j} a_i b_j \Be_i \Be_j
%+
%\sum_{i < j} a_j b_i (-\Be_i \Be_j)
=
\sum_{i < j} (a_i b_j - a_j b_i) \Be_i \Be_j.
\end{dmath}

\index{determinant!wedge product}
The scalar factors can be written as \( 2 x 2 \) determinants
\boxedEquation{eqn:products:1320}{
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\sum_{i < j}
\begin{vmatrix}
a_i & a_j \\
b_i & b_j
\end{vmatrix}
\Be_i \Be_j.
}

It is now straightforward to show that the wedge product is distributive and bilinear (\cref{problem:products:bilinear}).
It is also simple to use \cref{eqn:products:1320} to show that \( \Bb \wedge \Ba = -\Ba \wedge \Bb \) and \( \Ba \wedge \Ba = 0 \).

For \R{2} there is only one term in \cref{eqn:products:1320}

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:1720}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\begin{vmatrix}
a_1 & a_2 \\
b_1 & b_2
\end{vmatrix}
\Be_1 \Be_2.
\end{dmath}

\index{cross product}
We are used to writing the cross product as a \( 3 x 3 \) determinant, which can also be done with the coordinate expansion of the
\R{3} wedge product

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:products:1740}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\sum_{ ij \in \setlr{ 12, 13, 23 } }
\begin{vmatrix}
a_i & a_j \\
b_i & b_j
\end{vmatrix}
\Be_i \Be_j
=
\begin{vmatrix}
\Be_2 \Be_3 & \Be_3 \Be_1 & \Be_1 \Be_2 \\
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\
\end{vmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Let's summarize the wedge product properties and relations we have found so far, comparing the \R{3} wedge product to the cross product

\begin{tcolorbox}[tab2,tabularx={X||Y|Y},title=Cross product and \R{3} wedge product comparison.,boxrule=0.5pt]
Property & Cross product & Wedge product

Same vectors & \( \Ba \cross \Ba = 0 \) & \( \Ba \wedge \Ba = 0 \)

\end{vmatrix}
\)
&
\(
\Ba \wedge \Bb

\begin{vmatrix}
\Be_2 \Be_3 & \Be_3 \Be_1 & \Be_1 \Be_2 \\

\end{vmatrix}

\\ \hline
\end{tcolorbox}

All the wedge properties except the determinant expansion above are valid in any dimension.
Comparing \cref{eqn:products:1740} to the determinant representation of the cross product, and referring to
\cref{eqn:dual:1580}, shows that
the \R{3} wedge product is related to the cross product by a duality transformation \( i_{ab} = I \ncap_{ab} \),
or
\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1620}{
\Ba \wedge \Bb = I ( \Ba \cross \Bb ).
}

The direction of the cross product \( \Ba \cross \Bb \) is normal to the plane represented by the bivector \( \Ba \wedge \Bb \).  The magnitude of both (up to a sign) is the area of the parallelogram spanned by the two vectors.

\makeexample{Wedge and cross product relationship.}{example:products:2000}{
To take some of the abstraction from \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1620} let's consider a specific example.  Let
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:2020}
\begin{aligned}
\Ba &= \Be_1 + 2 \Be_2 + 3 \Be_3 \\
\Bb &= 4 \Be_1 + 5 \Be_2 + 6 \Be_3.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}
The reader should check that the cross product of these two vectors is
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:2040}
\Ba \cross \Bb = -3 \Be_1 - 6 \Be_2 - 3 \Be_3.
\end{dmath}
By direct computation, we find that the wedge and the cross products are related by a \R{3} pseudoscalar factor
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:products:2060}
\Ba \wedge \Bb
=
\lr{ \Be_1 + 2 \Be_2 + 3 \Be_3 } \wedge \lr{ 4 \Be_1 + 5 \Be_2 + 6 \Be_3 }
=
5 \Be_{12} + 6 \Be_{13}
+ 8 \Be_{21} + 12 \Be_{23}
+ 12 \Be_{31} + 15 \Be_{32}
=
3 \Be_{21} + 6 \Be_{31} + 3 \Be_{32}
=
-3 \Be_{12} - 6 \Be_{13} - 3 \Be_{23}
=
\Be_{123} (-3 \Be_{3}) + \Be_{132}(- 6 \Be_{2}) + \Be_{231}(- 3 \Be_{1})
=
\Be_{123} (-3 \Be_{3} - 6 \Be_{2} - 3 \Be_{1})
=
I (\Ba \cross \Bb).
\end{dmath}
} % example

The relationship between the wedge and cross products allows us to express the
\R{3} vector product as a multivector combination of the dot and cross products
\boxedEquation{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1640}{
\Ba \Bb = \Ba \cdot \Bb + I(\Ba \cross \Bb).
}

This is a very important relationship.

In particular, for electromagnetism, \cref{eqn:SimpleProducts2:1640} can
be used to combine (the scalar) Guass's law with (the vector) Maxwell-Faraday equation, and to
combine (the scalar) Gauss's law for magnetism with (the vector) Ampere-Maxwell equation.
Such dot plus cross product sums will yield
a pair of multivector equations that can be further merged.  The resulting multivector equation will be
called
Maxwell equation (singular), and will be the starting point of all our electromagnetic analysis.
