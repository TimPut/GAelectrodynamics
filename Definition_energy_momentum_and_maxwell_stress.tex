\makedefinition{Energy momentum and Maxwell stress tensors.}{dfn:poyntingF:1200}{
We define the \textit{energy momentum tensor} as
\begin{equation*}
T(a) = \inv{2} \epsilon F a F^\dagger,
\end{equation*}
where \( a \) is a grade \((0,1)\)-multivector parameter.
We introduce a shorthand notation for grade one selection with vector valued parameters
\begin{equation*}
\BT(\Ba) = \gpgradeone{T(\Ba)},
\end{equation*}
and call this the \textit{Maxwell stress tensor}.
