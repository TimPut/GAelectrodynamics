   Figure out how to do this with mmacell, and look at all the mathematica examples in this respect.

- Also: re: chapter II.

   At this point in time, this chapter is essentially is a write-once (except for Green's functions which has been reworked), read-none document. There are a number of things about it that I am not happy with. In particular, I think that the focus should be the fundamental theorem of geometric calculus. Right now, most of the early focus of the chapter is the GA form of Stokes' theorem, and the fundamental theorem is almost an afterthought. For single and double parameter volume elements I tie things to the geometry, but do not do so for trivector volume elements. I think it would be best to restructure this chapter as:

   - fundamental theorem: 1 parameter volume elements
   - fundamental theorem: 2 parameter volume elements
   - fundamental theorem: 3 parameter volume elements

   after each, show how that relates to equivalent conventional results.

   - finish off with a general statement of the fundamental theorem, and its connection to the general GA Stokes theorem.
   - move on to Green's functions after that.

   I'm not sure if there's really a good reason to include the Helmholtz theorem section at the end of the chapter. I happen to like it, since it's a nice compact derivation, but it's somewhat out of place since we don't have a good reason to work with separate divergence and curl operations in a GA context. Better would be a more general first order statement showing that the gradient (not its divergence and curl) uniquely determines the solution if the function or the Green's function vanishes on the boundary

- footnote about the CliffordBasic package now follows first use.  Add some more sample calculations, and move footnote earlier

   (perhaps generalizing to include other CAS engines like Maxima.)

- pruned Gradient Green's function completely.

   This introduces a couple dropped references:

     Reference `eqn:greensFunctionFirstOrderHelmholtz:660' on page 1 undefined on input line 115
     Reference `eqn:greensFunctionGradient:500' on page 1 undefined on input line 91
     Reference `thm:gradientGreensFunctionEuclidean:1' on page 1 undefined on input line 7

- Write up Green's derivation for the spacetime gradient and use it to derive the Griffiths results
  for E and B in terms of \rho, \dotrho, \BJ and \dot{\BJ}

-
   cylinderField.tex

      What was this?  It's now orphaned.

- far field application of Green's function for grad+jk.  GAFP does this nicely, but
it's a bit hard to follow, and their notation for the Green's function is not spelled
out for the uninitiated.  Perhaps try to do something like that, but in a more accessible
fashion (also not assuming mu = epsilon = c = 1 and using j \omega instead of -i \omega)

-
Now that I've got all the basic Green's function ideas down, there are two followup
steps:

1) Clean it up to remove redundancies.
2) Probably also want to cover the Green's function for the time domain
   spacetime gradient: \grad + (1/c) \partial_t and/or the wave equation
   in the time domain.

- placement of the primes in \lspacegrad' \rspacegrad' or their squares looks bad.

- now have a lot of redundancy in the Green's function stuff.  Can do this up front for all differential operators.

- write up derivation of 1st order Helmholtz Green's function.  probably want to prune the verification of the
plain gradient Green's function from the appendix (nice, but unneccessary ... also means that the R^n dependencies
don't have to be fixed up).

- With a standalone and complete discussion of Green's functions in chapter 2, may want to see if there is stuff to prune later.

- differentiate: have two different theorem's labelled Green's theorem (one for area, and other for bounded Green's fucntions)

- mmacells.sty dependency isn't properly in the make sequence.

- example for reflection.  Do this one in 3d.

- Dr Wolfgang Lindner:

   > The first chapter on linear GA is very "heavy/dry" mathematical stuff.
   Im my opinion it would be wise to spread some concerte calculations/examples
   through the text,
   perhaps every 2-3 pages


   I agree.  I started out with something very informal, and I think I've gone too far in the opposite direction now.  I'll see if I can work on finding a better balance.


   > -- also using some free CAS like REDUCE, MAXIMA or EIGENMATH.
   Give screenshots to let control/reproduce the results.
   This could activate the novice learner for keeping on the track ;)


   There are a number of GA CAS packages available in different languages.  Let me start with putting together an appendix listing some of the packages available, and giving examples of their use.
    
   MATHEMATICA is very good, but not free avaílable: my private version 4.0
   (1999)
   is very outdated. Maybe I can run your code, because you give txt-access to
   the *.m file.
    
   There are a few Mathematica GA packages available (mine, plus some others).  It's possible that one of the others will also work with Mathematica 4.  I like the integrated symbolic capability of Mathematica, and found that it justified the 'personal use licence' Mathematica purchase.  A full version for professional use is horrendously expensive.

- It should be clear how to generalize the reciprocal basis calculation formulas:

   -- statement is a cop-out.  fix.

   workaround: just deleted this for now.  Stick to \R{3} and below.

- Got to try plotting the ring fields.

- Lorentz force, boosts: gabookII chapter 35.  Is there a reasonable paravector implementation of this?

- gapauli

   - refresh .pdf's associated with the .nb's
   - have introduced Private symbols for GA13 (but not GA20, GA30)
   - StandardForm for GA13 now looks funny:

       {1},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][1]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][2]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][3]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][2] GA13`Private`\[Gamma][3]}
       ...

    A bigger issue is that cut and paste of the \gamma_... symbols from the various forms can be used as grade[...] operations.

- figure out how to factor out a grad dot operator from the Poynting stress equation.

- two new fixmes:  Add (or move) figures describing oriented bivectors and trivectors to where those are defined (before multivector space).

   - Also add cooresponding figures for vectors when those for bivectors are defined.

- Mo wanted me to double space things for editing.

   https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/819/double-line-spacing

   hook for that in thisbook.sty

      -- will have to remember to set double space whenever I am building a version that I want to sent him.

- hand drawn figures:

   Infinitesimal loop integral.
   Sum of infinitesimal loops
   Three parameter volume element

- superfluous use of:

   also
   observe
   many

   (probably lots of adjectives in general)

- spelling: unsure about these

   whos argument
   distributivity
   nondimensionalizing vs.  Non-dimensionalizing
   duals
   constitutivity
   subspaces
   reexpress
   factorizations

- copyright prologue check:

   for i in `cat spellcheckem.txt ` ; do grep -i copyright $i >/dev/null || echo $i ; done

- makeexample breaks in strange places sometimes.

- number line vs. 1d vector space plots show with different sizes.

- have boilerplate copyright.

- dedication.tex got cleaned out on make clean.  Rule that was in makefile doesn't appear to be right.  Revisit.

- exercise headers are bigger than the section headers (partially fixed)

- have inconsistent use of qedmarker.

- problem on <abc>_3 relation to wedge.  generalize that to _k.

- have some direct ref's that could use cref helper macros (forget how to do those though).

- Green's:
   Reference this derivation in Stokes' and make note of the fact that Stokes's derivation should properly consider the
   surface triangularization.

- Stokes'

   refer to the helper theorem \cref{} for in the problem.

- Fundamental theorem:

   Fixme's to deal with.
   Strip the definitions section out, since it should be covered previously.
   Bold vectors for Green's function.  Perhaps rework to be less general (assuming Euclidean).

- summation convention: any left?

- Review the whole doc for the use of \Abs instead of \Norm (believe that all the .tex files in this directory are now converted)

- fixmes:

   grep -ni fixme `cat spellcheckem.txt`

- table (2d multiplication) uses different color scheme, doesn't have a label or table number, and is too wide.

- figure for projection and rejection.  move from later material into SimpleProducts2
