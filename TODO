   dimensions of [eta \BF] should equal [c \BA], but do not here.

- I was also thinking of adding various symbols to the index, and probably putting a table of symbols somewhere for reference (perhaps with page references to the points of first use).

- make pdfs for mathematica notebooks.

- Pillbox figure.  Perhaps make a first figure that doesn't have the integration volume, but does have the
  regions, and an illustration of each of fields (vector+bivector) in each region.

- "employ the mean value theorem" :

   statement about the mean value theorem is vague, and notation is not defined.

- Have places that it would make sense to use label boxes.  I'd forgotten all about those.

- before a \makedefinition, theorem, ... should I end any sentance?  I think so, and don't in many places.

- colors: manually colored equations.  used:
      DarkOliveGreen,Maroon

      (general color scheme used elsewhere.)  Something that looks darker in equations might be nice.

- dielectric and dimagnetic:

   Can't I solve those using the Green's function method?

   Instead of showing the solution works, perhaps go the other way around?

- Is {eqn:isotropicMaxwells:520} the first use of \grad f = grad . f + I grad cross f?

(probably not: expect it's also in the Helmholtz content)

   This probably deserves some standalone discussion.

- Theorem 2.6: Line integral of a scalar function

   In proof of this theorem, the grade 2 component is ignored.  This probably deserves some thought and comment.
   Relation to vector curl in \R{3}?

- have now added a more complete proof of gagc up front.  Now need to streamline the surface and volume integral content.

- reciprocal frame: Alan:

   Better stated as a theorem. How do you know that there is a reciprocal frame? See my LAGA p. 94.

- Alan suggests:

   V is closed under addition

as "standard usage".  If I use that then I have to change all the rest too.  Look at some other examples of standard usage.

- Alan suggested that in the definition of

Euclidean

this word be italizized.

I've done that.  Look for other theorems/definitions where this should also be done.

- Stated the fundamental theorm and stokes expicitly.  Under line, surface (and volume when done), go back and reference
  those theorem statements, covering just the differences from the general statement.

  Perhaps try a general proof of Stokes from the fundamental theorem, and get rid of the proofs for the special cases.

  May be able to get rid of the references to the distribution theorems used in the original Stokes' proof.  Will there
  be value keeping those?

- had used bigwedge notation in Stokes but don't think I defined it.  removed it ... search for other instances of this.

- add symbols to the index.

- Mo review:

The only thing missing is an explicit enumeration of the basis elements for the complete R^3 geometric algebra.  i.e.

1

e1, e2, e3

e_12, e_23, e_31

e_123


- Mo suggested 'is' instead of 'can be' in the bivector definition.  I use 'can be' many times, and
  something more definitive might be better.

- We don’t usually try to represent of a quantity that has the
apparent dimensions of a point graphically.

   >> not clear to mo.

-
      If you are inclined to skip this, please at least examine the
      stated dot product definition, since the conventional positive definite property is not assumed.

   >> perhaps eliminate this, since no non-Euclidean metric use has been introduced.

-

   There is no (concrete or CAS) worked example for _Integration with GA_ yet.
   I think you will think about it ;)
   Maybe there is a typical problem from a course for electro-engineers ?

- I've made right handed assumptions in my area and volume integral formulations.  Need to clarify those, or make a note to
  ensure that we pick a parameterization for which the hypervolume element is positive with respect to the standard basis.

- In general want to show connection between the area/volume element and jacobean.

   Did that for the specific case of spherical polar parameterization in R{3}.

- Wolfgang.  email: e&m draft - Greens with MM: Suggestion:

   Idea: you could collect your formulas in 2.5 in a mathematica notebook, to give the reader the possibility to run/test the solutions. Maybe you could demonstate it using some code of clifford?

   => produce an Appendix with links to all the Mathematica notebooks.  Will need to add metadata references for them.

      ----------------------------------------------------------
      I think your impetus and your main motivation is to do Calculus using GA.
      IMO , therefore you should show some typical 'classical' vector analysis
      calculations using in contrast GA methods (plus MM).
      This is new, unusal and unkown and a big merit of your work/research -
      hence there should be in your ongoing work in the selection of contrasting
      examples and exercises in the spirit of
      [Mac]=[17] Macdonald (I like his style)
      or
      [Din] S. Dineen: "Multivariate Calculus and Geometry."
            Springer. ISBN 1-85233-472-X.
      (IMO a very good classical book with clear examples,
      struggeling for good understanding of concepts by the reader. No CAS used).
      I recommend to usesome examples/exercises form this books and solve them
      using GA ..

     WHERE:

         2.4.3 Two parameter specialization of Stokes’ theorem.

     RESOLUTION:

         Do this (as suggested for the line integral case).

- Helmholtz:

   I'm not sure if there's really a good reason to include the Helmholtz theorem section at the end of the chapter. I happen to like it, since it's a nice compact derivation, but it's somewhat out of place since we don't have a good reason to work with separate divergence and curl operations in a GA context. Better would be a more general first order statement showing that the gradient (not its divergence and curl) uniquely determines the solution if the function or the Green's function vanishes on the boundary

- footnote about the CliffordBasic package now follows first use.  Add some more sample calculations, and move footnote earlier

   (perhaps generalizing to include other CAS engines like Maxima.)

-
   cylinderField.tex

      What was this?  It's now orphaned.

- far field application of Green's function for grad+jk.  GAFP does this nicely, but
it's a bit hard to follow, and their notation for the Green's function is not spelled
out for the uninitiated.  Perhaps try to do something like that, but in a more accessible
fashion (also not assuming mu = epsilon = c = 1 and using j \omega instead of -i \omega)

- placement of the primes in \lspacegrad' \rspacegrad' or their squares looks bad.

- differentiate: have two different theorem's labelled Green's theorem (one for area, and other for bounded Green's fucntions)

- mmacells.sty dependency isn't properly in the make sequence.

- example for reflection.  Do this one in 3d.

- Dr Wolfgang Lindner:

   > The first chapter on linear GA is very "heavy/dry" mathematical stuff.
   Im my opinion it would be wise to spread some concerte calculations/examples
   through the text,
   perhaps every 2-3 pages


   I agree.  I started out with something very informal, and I think I've gone too far in the opposite direction now.  I'll see if I can work on finding a better balance.


   > -- also using some free CAS like REDUCE, MAXIMA or EIGENMATH.
   Give screenshots to let control/reproduce the results.
   This could activate the novice learner for keeping on the track ;)


   There are a number of GA CAS packages available in different languages.  Let me start with putting together an appendix listing some of the packages available, and giving examples of their use.
    
   MATHEMATICA is very good, but not free avaílable: my private version 4.0
   (1999)
   is very outdated. Maybe I can run your code, because you give txt-access to
   the *.m file.
    
   There are a few Mathematica GA packages available (mine, plus some others).  It's possible that one of the others will also work with Mathematica 4.  I like the integrated symbolic capability of Mathematica, and found that it justified the 'personal use licence' Mathematica purchase.  A full version for professional use is horrendously expensive.

- It should be clear how to generalize the reciprocal basis calculation formulas:

   -- statement is a cop-out.  fix.

   workaround: just deleted this for now.  Stick to \R{3} and below.

- Got to try plotting the ring fields.

- Lorentz force, boosts: gabookII chapter 35.  Is there a reasonable paravector implementation of this?

- gapauli

   - refresh .pdf's associated with the .nb's
   - have introduced Private symbols for GA13 (but not GA20, GA30)
   - StandardForm for GA13 now looks funny:

       {1},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][1]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][2]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][3]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][2] GA13`Private`\[Gamma][3]}
       ...

    A bigger issue is that cut and paste of the \gamma_... symbols from the various forms can be used as grade[...] operations.

- figure out how to factor out a grad dot operator from the Poynting stress equation.

- two new fixmes:  Add (or move) figures describing oriented bivectors and trivectors to where those are defined (before multivector space).

   - Also add cooresponding figures for vectors when those for bivectors are defined.

- Mo wanted me to double space things for editing.

   https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/819/double-line-spacing

   hook for that in thisbook.sty

      -- will have to remember to set double space whenever I am building a version that I want to sent him.

- hand drawn figures:

   Infinitesimal loop integral.
   Sum of infinitesimal loops
   Three parameter volume element

- superfluous use of:

   also
   observe
   many

   (probably lots of adjectives in general)

- spelling: unsure about these

   whos argument
   distributivity
   nondimensionalizing vs.  Non-dimensionalizing
   duals
   constitutivity
   subspaces
   reexpress
   factorizations

- copyright prologue check:

   for i in `cat spellcheckem.txt ` ; do grep -i copyright $i >/dev/null || echo $i ; done

- makeexample breaks in strange places sometimes.

- number line vs. 1d vector space plots show with different sizes.

- have boilerplate copyright.

- dedication.tex got cleaned out on make clean.  Rule that was in makefile doesn't appear to be right.  Revisit.

- exercise headers are bigger than the section headers (partially fixed)

- have inconsistent use of qedmarker.

- problem on <abc>_3 relation to wedge.  generalize that to _k.

- have some direct ref's that could use cref helper macros (forget how to do those though).

- Green's:
   Reference this derivation in Stokes' and make note of the fact that Stokes's derivation should properly consider the
   surface triangularization.

- Stokes'

   refer to the helper theorem \cref{} for in the problem.

- Fundamental theorem:

   Fixme's to deal with.
   Strip the definitions section out, since it should be covered previously.
   Bold vectors for Green's function.  Perhaps rework to be less general (assuming Euclidean).

- summation convention: any left?

- Review the whole doc for the use of \Abs instead of \Norm (believe that all the .tex files in this directory are now converted)

- fixmes:

   grep -ni fixme `cat spellcheckem.txt`

- table (2d multiplication) uses different color scheme, doesn't have a label or table number, and is too wide.

- figure for projection and rejection.  move from later material into SimpleProducts2
