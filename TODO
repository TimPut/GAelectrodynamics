- Got to try plotting the ring fields.

- Lorentz force, boosts: gabookII chapter 35.  Is there a reasonable paravector implementation of this?

- gapauli

   - refresh .pdf's associated with the .nb's
   - have introduced Private symbols for GA13 (but not GA20, GA30)
   - StandardForm for GA13 now looks funny:

       {1},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][1]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][2]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][3]},
       {GA13`Private`\[Gamma][2] GA13`Private`\[Gamma][3]}
       ...

    A bigger issue is that cut and paste of the \gamma_... symbols from the various forms can be used as grade[...] operations.

- figure out how to factor out a grad dot operator from the Poynting stress equation.

- two new fixmes:  Add (or move) figures describing oriented bivectors and trivectors to where those are defined (before multivector space).

   - Also add cooresponding figures for vectors when those for bivectors are defined.

- Mo wanted me to double space things for editing.

   https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/819/double-line-spacing

   hook for that in thisbook.sty

      -- will have to remember to set double space whenever I am building a version that I want to sent him.

- hand drawn figures:

   Infinitesimal loop integral.
   Sum of infinitesimal loops
   Three parameter volume element

- superfluous use of:

   also
   observe
   many

   (probably lots of adjectives in general)

- spelling: unsure about these

   whos argument
   distributivity
   nondimensionalizing vs.  Non-dimensionalizing
   duals
   constitutivity
   subspaces
   reexpress
   factorizations

- copyright prologue check:

   for i in `cat spellcheckem.txt ` ; do grep -i copyright $i >/dev/null || echo $i ; done

- makeexample breaks in strange places sometimes.

- number line vs. 1d vector space plots show with different sizes.

- have boilerplate copyright.

- dedication.tex got cleaned out on make clean.  Rule that was in makefile doesn't appear to be right.  Revisit.

- exercise headers are bigger than the section headers (partially fixed)

- have inconsistent use of qedmarker.

- problem on <abc>_3 relation to wedge.  generalize that to _k.

- have some direct ref's that could use cref helper macros (forget how to do those though).

- Green's:
   Reference this derivation in Stokes' and make note of the fact that Stokes's derivation should properly consider the
   surface triangularization.

- Stokes'

   refer to the helper theorem \cref{} for in the problem.

- Fundamental theorem:

   Fixme's to deal with.
   Strip the definitions section out, since it should be covered previously.
   Bold vectors for Green's function.  Perhaps rework to be less general (assuming Euclidean).

- summation convention: any left?

- Review the whole doc for the use of \Abs instead of \Norm (believe that all the .tex files in this directory are now converted)

- fixmes:

   grep -ni fixme `cat spellcheckem.txt`

- table (2d multiplication) uses different color scheme, doesn't have a label or table number, and is too wide.

- figure for projection and rejection.  move from later material into SimpleProducts2
