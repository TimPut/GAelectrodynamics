- add my copyright prologue to all files.

- number line vs. 1d vector space plots show with different sizes.

- have boilerplate copyright.

- dedication.tex got cleaned out on make clean.  Rule that was in makefile doesn't appear to be right.  Revisit.

- strip document version info

- exercise headers are bigger than the section headers (partially fixed)

- have inconsistent use of qedmarker.

- problem on <abc>_3 relation to wedge.  generalize that to _k.

- Green's:
   Redo the hand drawn figures. 
   Reference this derivation in Stokes' and make note of the fact that Stokes's derivation should properly consider the
   surface triangularization.

- Stokes'

   refer to the helper theorem \cref{} for in the problem.

- Fundamental theorem:

   Fixme's to deal with.
   Strip the definitions section out, since it should be covered previously.
   Bold vectors for Green's function.  Perhaps rework to be less general (assuming Euclidean).
   Redo the hand drawn figures. 

- Get rid of summation convention for engineering

- add frequency domain representation of Poynting theorem

- incorporate Mauro's potential_v2 which was nicely done.

- Review the whole doc for the use of \Abs instead of \Norm (believe that all the .tex files in this directory are now converted)

- fixmes:

grep -ni fixme *.tex

- table (2d multiplication) uses different color scheme, doesn't have a label or table number, and is too wide.

- add lots of indexing to SimpleProducts2.tex SimpleProducts.tex

- figure for projection and rejection.  move from later material into SimpleProducts2

- use the words also and observe too much.  Is often superfluous.
