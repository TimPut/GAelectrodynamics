\makedefinition{Multivector k-volume integral.}{dfn:fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus:240}{
Given a hypervolume parameterized by \( k \) parameters, k-volume volume element \( d^k \Bx \), and
multivector functions \( F, G \), a k-volume integral with the vector derivative acting to the right on \( G \) is written as
\begin{equation*}
\int_V d^k\Bx \rboldpartial G,
\end{equation*}
a k-volume integral with the vector derivative acting to the left on \( F \) is written as
\begin{equation*}
\int_V F d^k\Bx \lboldpartial,
\end{equation*}
and a \textit{multivector k-volume integral} with the vector derivative acting bidirectionally on \( F, G \) is written as
\begin{equation*}
\int_V F d^k\Bx \lrboldpartial G
\equiv
\int_V \lr{ F d^k\Bx \lboldpartial} G
+
\int_V F d^k\Bx \lr{ \rboldpartial G }.
\end{equation*}
The explicit meaning of these directionally acting derivative operations is given by the following chain rule coordinate expansion
\begin{dmath*}
F d^k \Bx \lrboldpartial G
=
F d^k \Bx \lr{ \sum_i \Bx^i {\stackrel{ \leftrightarrow }{\partial_i}} } G
=
(\partial_i F) d^k \Bx \sum_i \Bx^i G
+
F d^k \Bx \sum_i \Bx^i (\partial_i G)
\equiv
(F d^k \Bx \lboldpartial) G
+
F d^k \Bx (\rboldpartial G),
\end{dmath*}
with \( \boldpartial \) acting on \( F \) and \( G \), but not the volume element \( d^k \Bx \), which may also be a function of the implied parameterization.
