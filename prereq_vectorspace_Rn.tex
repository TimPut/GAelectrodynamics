Define \R{N} as the set of tuples \( \setlr{ (x_1, x_2, \cdots) \mid x_i \in \bbR } \).
Show that \R{N} is a vector space when the
addition operation is defined as
\( \Bx + \By \equiv (x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, \cdots) \)
, and
scalar multiplication
is defined as
\( a \Bx \equiv (a x_1 , a x_2 , \cdots ) \) for any
\( \Bx = (x_1, x_2, \cdots) \in \bbR^N \),
\( \By = (y_1, y_2, \cdots) \in \bbR^N \), and
\( a \in \bbR \).
