The \textit{divergence theorem} may be generalized in
\R{3} to multivectors \( M \) containing grades 0,1, or 2, but no grade 3 components
\begin{equation*}
\int_V dV \spacegrad \cdot M = \int_{\partial V} dA \ncap \cdot M,
\end{equation*}
where \( \ncap \) is the normal to the surface bounding \( V \) given by \( d^2 \Bx = I \ncap dA \).
