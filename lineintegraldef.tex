In geometric algebra, the integrand of a multivector line integral contains product of multivector(s) and a single parameter differential
\makedefinition{Multivector line integral.}{dfn:lineintegraldef:multivectorlineintegral}{
Given a continuous and differentiable curve described by a vector function \( \Bx(a) \), parameterized by single value \( a \) with differential
\begin{equation*}
d^1 \Bx \equiv d\Bx_a = \PD{a}{\Bx} da = \Bx_a da,
\end{equation*}
and multivector functions \( F, G \), the integral
\begin{equation*}
\int F d^1 \Bx G
\end{equation*}
is called a line integral.
} % definition

An illustration of a single parameter curve and its
differential with respect to that parameter, is given in
\cref{fig:oneParameterDifferential:oneParameterDifferentialFig1}.
Observe that the differential is tangent to the curve at all points.
Possible physical realizations of the parameter describing the curve include
time, arclength, and angle.

Suppose that \( \Bf(\Bx(a)) \) is a vector valued function defined along the curve.
The conventional line integral from vector calculus, a dot product of a differential and the function \( \Bf \) 
may be obtained by the sum of two multivector line integrals one with \( F,G = \Bf/2,1 \), and the other with \( F,G = 1,\Bf/2 \)
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:lineintegraldef:20}
\int d^1 \Bx \frac{\Bf}{2}
+\int
\frac{\Bf}{2}
d^1 \Bx
=
\int d^1 \Bx \cdot \Bf.
\end{dmath}
Unlike the conventional dot product line integral, the multivector line integral of a vector function such as \( \int d^1 \Bx \Bf \) is generally multivector valued, with both a scalar and a bivector component.  Let's consider some examples of multivector line integrals.
