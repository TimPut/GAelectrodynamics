\makeproblem{\R{4} wedge of a non-blade with itself.}{problem:gradeselection:r4nonzerobivectorwedgewithself}{
While the wedge product of a blade with itself is always zero, this is not generally true of the wedge products of arbitrary k-vectors in higher dimensional spaces.
To demonstrate this, show that the wedge of the bivector
\( B = \Be_1 \Be_2 + \Be_3 \Be_4 \) with itself is non-zero.
Why is this bivector not a blade?
%, show that \( B \wedge B \ne 0 \).
