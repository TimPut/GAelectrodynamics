A book on Geometric Algebra applications to electromagnetism.

The target audience are undergraduate student with sufficient background in electromagnetism that knowledge of Maxwell's equations can be presumed.
Alternatives to the usual 3D vector or coordinate based derivations of various problems will be presented that highlight some of the ways that Geometric Algebra can be used to tackle electromagnetic problems.

\paragraph{These notes contain:}

\begin{itemize}
\item An introduction to Geometric Algebra (GA).
\item Application of Geometric Algebra to electromagnetism, with a focus on engineering applications.
\end{itemize}

There are two potential audiences for these notes.  The first is for a student new to GA faced with the learning curve of both GA itself and the notational changes needed to apply it to electromagnetism.  The second audience is the individual who already has some knowledge of GA, and may want to skim yet another boilerplate ``Introduction to Geometric Algebra'' to get an idea of the notation in use, and move on to the electromagnetism applications.  To serve both potential audiences, much of the substance of the introductory GA material has been deferred to the problems.  Students new to GA should attempt all these problems before falling back to just reading the solutions.
