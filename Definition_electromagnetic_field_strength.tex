\makedefinition{Electromagnetic field strength.}{dfn:isotropicMaxwells:640}{
The \textit{electromagnetic field strength} ([\si{V/m}] (Volts/meter)) is defined as
\begin{equation*}
F = \BE + I \eta \BH \quad(= \BE + I c \BB),
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item \( \eta = \sqrt{\mu/\epsilon} \) (\( [\Omega] \) Ohms), is the impedance of the media.
\item \( c = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu} \) ([\si{m/s}] meters/second), is the group velocity of a wave in the media.
When \( \epsilon = \epsilon_0, \mu = \mu_0 \), \( c \) is the speed of light.
\end{itemize}
\( F \) is called the \textit{F}araday by some authors.
