\maketheorem{Poynting's theorem (differential form.)}{thm:poyntingTheorem:1180}{
The adjoint energy momentum tensor of the spacetime gradient satisfies the following multivector equation
\begin{equation*}
\overbar{T}(\spacegrad + (1/c)\partial_t) = \frac{\epsilon}{2} \lr{ F^\dagger J + J^\dagger F }.
\end{equation*}
Note that the multivector \( F^\dagger J + J^\dagger F \) can only have scalar and vector grades, since it equals its reverse.
This equation can be put into a form that is more obviously a conservation law by stating it as a set of
scalar grade identities
\begin{equation*}
\spacegrad \cdot \gpgradeone{ T(a) } + \inv{c} \PD{t}{} \gpgradezero{ T(a) }
=
\frac{\epsilon}{2} \gpgradezero{ a( F^\dagger J + J \dagger F) }.
\end{equation*}
These may be written as respective
scalar and vector grades equations
%%which expands to the multivector equation
%\begin{equation*}
%\inv{c} \PD{t}{} \lr{ \calE - \frac{\BS}{c} }
%+ \spacegrad \cdot \frac{\BS}{c}
%+ \BT(\spacegrad)
%=
%-\inv{c} \lr{ \BE \cdot \BJ + \BH \cdot \BM }
%+
%\rho \BE + \epsilon \BE \cross \BM
%+
%\rho_\txtm \BH + \mu \BJ \cross \BH,
%\end{equation*}
%or as separate scalar and vector equations
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\inv{c} \PD{t}{\calE} + \spacegrad \cdot \frac{\BS}{c} &= -\inv{c} \lr{ \BE \cdot \BJ + \BH \cdot \BM } \\
-\inv{c^2} \PD{t}{\BS} + \BT(\spacegrad) &= \rho \BE + \epsilon \BE \cross \BM + \rho_\txtm \BH + \mu \BJ \cross \BH.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Conventionally, only the scalar grade relating the time rate of change of the energy density to the flux of the Poynting vector, is called Poynting's theorem.
