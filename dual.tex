\makedefinition{Dual}{dfn:definitions:dual}{
The dual of a multivector is the product of that multivector with a pseudoscalar for a subspace that contains the multivector.  Such multiplication is referred to as a duality transformation.
} % definition

For example, given \( M = 1 + \Be_1 \Be_2 \), multiplication by \( i = \Be_1 \Be_2 \) is a duality transformation with respect to the x-y plane, and multiplication by \( I = \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \) is a duality transformation with \R{3}.

(cut)
consider some concrete examples of duality transformations of blades.
The dual vectors to the basis vectors of a 2D space are those same vectors rotated by \( \pi/2 \)

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:definitions:360}
\begin{aligned}
\Be_1 \Be_{12} &= \Be_2 \\
\Be_2 \Be_{12} &= -\Be_1,
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

with an inverse duality transformation given by the multiplication with \( \Be_{12}^{-1} = \Be_{21} \)

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:definitions:440}
\begin{aligned}
\Be_2 \Be_{21} &= \Be_1 \\
-\Be_1 \Be_{21} &= \Be_2.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

The \R{3} duals to the basis vectors are bivectors

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:definitions:380}
\begin{aligned}
\Be_1 \Be_{123} &= \Be_{23} \\
\Be_2 \Be_{123} &= \Be_{31} \\
\Be_3 \Be_{123} &= \Be_{12},
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

whereas the duals to those bivectors with respect to the pseudoscalar \( I^{-1} = \Be_{321} \) are the original basis vectors

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:definitions:400}
\begin{aligned}
\Be_{23} \Be_{321} &= \Be_1 \\
\Be_{31} \Be_{321} &= \Be_2 \\
\Be_{12} \Be_{321} &= \Be_3.
\end{aligned}
\end{dmath}

In a sense that can be defined more precisely once the general dot product operator is defined, the dual to a given blade represents an object that is normal to the original blade.

The dual of any scalar is a pseudoscalar, whereas the dual of a pseudoscalar is a scalar.

%When working with multivector integrals it will be useful to consider the differential volume element a volume weighted pseudoscalar.
